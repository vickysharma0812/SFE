## Ignition temperature in forest

The ignition temperature of forest fuels refers to the minimum temperature at which biomass (such as leaves, grasses, shrubs, and trees) ignites and sustains combustion without an external flame.

In forests, this ignition point varies widely depending on:

- Fuel type (e.g., grasses, pine needles, woody material)
- Moisture content
- Density and composition (volatile compounds, resins, etc.)
- Ambient environmental conditions (heat source characteristics)

### Ignitability

- Ignitability is also quantified by the time to ignition after exposure to a heat source or amount of heat required for ignition.
- Ignitability is important for predicting if a forest is likely to burn and how easily the fire will spread.
- Therefore, at any specific source intensity, the most ignitible fuel is the one that ignites in the shortest exposure time.

 Wildfires can start from firebrands, lightning strikes or an established fire front.
 Each of these ignition sources are likely to have a different heat output and therefore a different ignition potential.

### Preignition

- When forest fuels burn in wildland fires, they first go through a phase called preignition, which requires energy (endothermic).
  - During this phase, as the fuel heats up, it loses water (dehydration) and releases gases from organic materials (volatilization).
- Volatile compounds such as terpenoid hydrocarbons volatilize at low temperatures
- At higher temperatures begins the process of pyrolysis of the forest fuels.
  - Pyrolysis breaks down the substance molecules into low molecular mass gases (volatiles), tars, carbonaceous char and mineral ash.
- Cellulose is the main component of forest fuels.
  - The thermal degradation of cellulose begins at around 280-400 °C
  - This thermal degradation follows two competing pathways.
    - One is the dehydration, which leads to char, and gases (mainly CO, CO2, H2O)
    - Other is the depolymerisation, which leads to tar and volatiles through the formation of levoglucosan producing flammable gases and char.
  - High temperature and high heating rate favour the formation of volatiles (the second pathway)
  - Low temperature and low heating rate favour the formation of char (the first pathway)

### Combustion

The second phase of burning process is exothermic and it is known as combustion.

- Combustion may be with or without flame.
- Combustion with the flame is a gas oxidation reaction, which is accompanied by the emission of flames.
  - It takes place when the temperature of the volatiles, emerging through the surface of the forest fuels reaches 450-500 °C.
- The combustion without flame is called smoldering combustion.
  - It is associated with the oxidation of the char
  - It provides the heat necessary for the pyrolysis of the forest fuels
  - It is an important part of forest fires because it is relaated to ground fires in the organic soil horizon which could last for months and even years.
  
### Ignition

- Ignition is the transition between the preignition aand combustion phase.
- It is the temperature at which a pilot source of heat is no longer required.
- Once ignited the heat generated by the combusion brings other fuel to ignition temperature thus spreading the fire.

### Summary

- Kanuary has found that the minimum surface temperature (critical surface temperature) of wood under radiative heating mode for spontaneous ignition is 600 °C and for piloted ignition 300–410 °C. With convective heating the spontaneous ignition, occurred at 490 °C and with piloted ignition 450 °C [^7].
- In addition, 2.5 g m−2 s−1 is reported as the minimum supply of fuel vapors (pyrolysis rate) for ignition.
- From the literature is shown that both the minimum pyrolysis rate and the minimum surface temperature can be used as criteria for ignition.

## Reading materials on damage due to storms in forests

The following reports discuss the damage caused by storms in forests in Europe and the implications for forest management and policy. Please read first two chapters from this report in your own time.

### Living with the storm damage to forests

[Gardiner, B., Schuck, A., Schelhaas, M. J., Orazio, C., Blennow, K., & Nicoll, B. (Eds.) (2013). Living with storm damage to forests. (What science can tell us; No. 3). European Forest Institute. http://www.efi.int/files/attachments/publications/efi_wsctu_3_final_net.pdf](http://www.efi.int/files/attachments/publications/efi_wsctu_3_final_net.pdf)

Windstorms are a major disturbance factor for European forests.
In the past six decades wind storms have damaged standing forest volume,
which on a yearly average equals about the size of Poland's annual fellings.
The evedence also indicates that the actual severity of storms in the wake of
climatic changes may increase during next decades.Windstorms damages have many environmental,
economic and social implications.

## Bark beetles (instect attacks in forests)

Bark beetles have a strong association with specific types of fungi,
often in a symbiotic relationship where both benefit.
These fungi, particularly ophiostomatoid fungi, can help bark beetles colonize trees,
weaken their defenses, and are sometimes also a source of nutrients.
The fungi can also be a food source for the beetles.

The following article talks about hte relationship between bark beetles and fungi:
