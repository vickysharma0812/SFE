## Effect of temperature on biological processes

Rising temperatures influence reaction rates and enzyme activity, thereby impacting DNA replication, cell division, and other essential cellular processes.

Increase in temperature often leads to more enzyme activity, but extreme temperatures can denature enzymes, leading to decreased activity.

The organism which can tolerate a range of temperature often equipped with heat loss mechanisms such as evaporation mechanisms. For example, humans sweat when the temperature is very high. This is called evaporative cooling.
Cold-blooded animals, such as reptiles, can alter the body temperature to match their surroundings.

::: {.callout-note title="Why should be care about bilogical processes vs temperature?"}

Due to the climate change, unusual temperature changes are observed in almost every part of the world. This means the habitats of microorganisms are also undergoing unusual temperature variations. If we can study how the bilogical processes changes with temperature, we can develop mathematical models which can help us in quantifying the effect of temperature change on such microorganisms. This can help us in predicting the future of such microorganisms and their habitats.

We can classified organisms into following categories based on their the temperature of their habitats.

- Stenothermal organisms: These organisms can only tolerate a narrow range of temperatures. For example, some fish species are stenothermal and can only survive in specific temperature ranges. These organisms are further divided into Thermophilic and Cryophilic organisms.
  - Thermophilic organisms: These organisms thrive at high temperatures, often above 45°C. They are commonly found in hot springs and hydrothermal vents.
  - Cryophilic organisms: These organisms thrive at low temperatures, often below 20°C including subzero temperatures. They are commonly found in polar regions and deep-sea environments.

- Eurythermal organisms: These organisms can tolerate a wide range of temperatures.

- Extremophiles organisms: These organisms can survive in extreme conditions, including high temperatures, high salinity, and extreme pH levels. They are often found in extreme environments such as hot springs, salt flats, and deep-sea hydrothermal vents.

We can also classify organisms into endothermic and ectothermic organisms based on their ability to regulate body temperature.

- Endothermic organisms: These organisms can regulate their body temperature internally, often through metabolic processes. They are commonly referred to as warm-blooded animals. Examples include mammals and birds.
- Ectothermic organisms: These organisms rely on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. They are commonly referred to as cold-blooded animals. Examples include reptiles, amphibians, and fish.

## Temperature and Tree growth

Plants regulate their temperature by dissipating part of thermal energy they absorb. In this way, they prevent them from injury and death due to excessive high temperature. Plants use heat transfer mechanisms to transfer heat to their environment. These mechanisms were discussed in Lecture 4. The heat transfer due to radiation will be discussed in Lecture 5.

Plant can function properly under a broad range of temperature, generally between 0 and 50 degree C. Low temperature usually decreases the rate of photosynthesis. Nevertheless, significant photosynthesis can occur in conifers in cold climate. 

As temperature increases, plant activities increases upto an optimum temperature. Temperature increase beyond optimum value can decreases the plant activities. Following processes are influenced strongly due to the temperature:

1. The activities of enzymes which catalyze the biochemical reactions in plant cells
2. The solubility of carbon dioxide and oxygen in plant cells
3. Tranpiration 
4. The ability of root system to absorb water and nutrients
5. Membrane permeability

In a plant different growth processes may require different optimum temperatures. Therefore, we cannot say that there is a single optimum temperature for which rate of plant growth or biomass product is highest. In this way, in a plant some growth happens at day time, some growth happen at night time.

::: {.callout-note}

The difference between night time temperature and day time temperature is called thermoperiod.
:::

We have discussed in the class that the rate of photosynthesis is highest at the optimum temperature. When  temperature increases above the optimum temperature the rate of photosynthesis decreases. For example at about 30 degree C, many enzymes tend to become disrupted. If high temperature remains for a long period the enzymes become nonfunctional. 

We also discussed in Lecture 4 that respiration increases greatly at very high temperature (50 degree C). Therefore, at very high temperature respiration will be higher than the photosynthesis. The respiration help the plant in releasing excess heat. But if the temperature increases further, it can result in death of plant cells. May studies have shown that the dangerous point occur at about 55 degree C.

A plant can also rearrange its leaves so that it receives less sunlight. In this way, the plan can decreases the intake of thermal energy. For example when red maple seedlings are subjected to high light intensities, the leaf blades are deflected downward until they hand in a vertical position. In this position the light is tangential to the leaves and they minimizes the intake of thermal energy. When these seedlings are put in shade they return to the horizontal position.

## Cold injury to plants

When temperature drops below 0 degree C, the water in the plant cells freezes. This can cause damage to the plant cells. The freezing of water in the plant cells can cause the formation of ice crystals, which can puncture and rupture the cell membranes. This can lead to cell death and tissue damage.

:::{.callout-note title="Process of freezing in plants"}
First the water between the two cells freezes. This type of freezing will create cryo-suction outside the cell zone, which will move water from the cell to outer freezing area. In this way, the amount of water in the cell decreases and it reaches to a point where there is only bounded water inside the cell (protoplasm). As temperature decreases furture, bound water is pulled away from the protoplasm. This process initiate  protein denaturation and ultimately causing death of the cell.
:::

In tropical plants, death may occur at above freezing temperatures from 0 to 10 degree C.

Rapid thawing in plants can also cause damage to the plant cells. When the temperature rises rapidly, the ice crystals in the plant cells can melt too quickly, causing the cell membranes to rupture. This can lead to cell death and tissue damage.

Most trees in temperate and boreal zones starts to become inactive when the length of the day shortens and temperature drops. The plant lowers the water content of protoplasm by transferring water out of cells. Many species are able to survive below zero temperature without damage.

## Boundary layer

- The boundary layer is a thin zone of calm air that surrounds each leaf.
- The air is a poor conductor of heat. What it means is that the presence of SLOW moving air between two objects will reduce the rate of heat transfer between these two objects. Note that we are talking here about the SLOW or STATIC air (this is important). If the thickness of SLOW moving air is large, the heat transfer becomes more difficult. Therefore, a thin layer is more conducting then the thick layer.
- The moving air can remove heat more quickly than the static air. This is because the moving air can carry away the heat from the surface of the leaf more efficiently than the static air. The moving air can also bring in cooler air to replace the warmer air that is near the surface of the leaf.
- Therefore, if the leaves are in direct contact with the moving air, they can easily exchange heat with it. However, if the boundary layer is present between the moving (FAST moving) air and leaves then it would be difficult to exchange heat with the air.

:::{.callout-note}
 A thick boundary layer can reduce the transfer of heat, CO2 and water vapor from the leaf to the environment.
:::

- There are several factors that influence the boundary layer thickness including characteristics of the leaves themselves. Leaves that are larger in size, are not dissected, and have pubescence or hairs typically have thicker boundary layers.
- A dense canopy including very tight spacing of plants increases the boundary layer thickness. This is because the leaves are closer together and the air is not able to move freely between them. This can lead to a thicker boundary layer and reduced heat transfer.
- Wind speed can also influence the boundary layer thickness. Higher wind speeds can reduce the boundary layer thickness by increasing the movement of air around the leaves. This can lead to more efficient heat transfer and increased cooling of the leaves.
- This is one of the reasons why at least some air movement in a greenhouse is advised.

- So when the boundary layer is thick, water loss from the leaf decreases and thus, water uptake through plant is diminished. This can cause nutrient deficiency.

Following video explains the concept of boundary layer in detail.
