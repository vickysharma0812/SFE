# Questions asked in Lecture 2

## Landscape ecosystem

The following points were discussed in the lecture.

- An ecosystem is a community of living organisms (plants, animals, and microorganisms) interacting with their physical environment (soil, water, and air).
- Forest is a type of landscape ecosystem.

::: {.callout-note title="What do we have two terms landscape-ecosystem and ecosystem?" }
In my opinion, both ecosystem and landscape ecosystem are essentially the same. The term ecosystem is very general. However, from landscape ecosystem we want to emphasis that we are interested in studying the ecosystem which have finite volume such as forest. So such ecosystem are located on the specific parts of the earth. They have their own environment, and in this environment their can be so population of many types of species.

- I think to study the forest ecosystem, the first question that we should ask is where is that forest located on the earth?
- Is it is a tropical forest, or temperate forest, or boreal forest?
- Then we decide our are of interest by fixing the spatial scale of the forest ecosystem. This will fix the volume of the forest in the horizontal direction. Imagine a box which contains a part of very large forest.
- After fixing the volume of the forest, we see what types of living organisms are present in that volume.
- Then we see what is the geography in that volume, For example, what is the soil type, what is the water type, what is the air type, what is the temperature, what is the humidity, what is the light intensity, etc. We also check the topography.
- In summary, in  landscape ecosystem, and forest ecosystem, the landscape comes first, and then we study the components of that landscape. Whereas in general, many people are interested in studying an organism or species, or population. But if use such approach for a forest we have so many species and their ecosystem. Finding how these ecosystem (infinitely many) interacts with each other will be a challenging task if not impossible task.



## Different layers of a forest ecosystem

To understand the different layers of a forest ecosystem, we need to follow the following steps.

1. The forest ecosystem occupy a finite volume (small or larger) on the earth's surface.

2. The conditions, such as temperature, humidity, light, soil type, nutrients, rainfall (amount and frequency) will change across the earth surface. In this way, different types of plants (species) will grow at different location on the earth. Even if we focus on same species, their growth will be different at different location. This is because the conditions are different at different locations. This gives a horizontal structure to forest. All it means that the growth, species of plants and trees changes as the location changes.

3. Now let us focus on the vertical structure of a forest. The vertical structure of the forest is divided in the terms of layers. For example, our body has differnt layers: 
    - Leg area: This is the area below the hip
    - Hip area: This is the area around the hip
    - Stomach area: This is the area around the stomach
    - Head area: This is the area around the head

Similarly, in the forest at given location on the earth, we have different layers in the vertical direction. Now why in the vertical direction? Because at given location the trees are growing in the vertical direction (both up and down (roots)). 

Now, Let us focus on a SINGLE tree at a given location. What type of layers do we observe?
1. Root area (this is like leg area) below the ground
2. Trunk area (this is like hip and stomach area) above the ground
3. Crown area: Branch area (this is like head area) above the ground.
4. Canopy area: This is the area above the crown area. This is the area where the leaves are present.

Now let us combine many trees at a given location. Let say we planted them together. Over the time they will grow at the different rate. Some trees will be taller and thicker. Some trees will be shorter. This the first generation of tree. They have same age, but their characteristics are different. After some years lets plant another generation of trees. Now in the forest we will have younger and older trees. Every individual tree has vertical structure. 

The combination of these trees is what make the forest. So the forest also have several vertical layers. These layers were discussed in the lecture.

## Tropical ecosystem

One student found it difficult to understand the tropical ecosystem. 


- The tropical ecosystem is a type of forest ecosystem. 
- It is a forest ecosystem that is located in the tropics. 
- The tropics are the regions of the earth that are located between the Tropic of Cancer (23 degree North) and the Tropic of Capricorn (23 degree  South).
- These regions are characterized by warm temperatures and high levels of rainfall. In general, as the latitude increases, the temperature decreases. Arctic and Antartica both have largest latitude in North and Sourth, respectively. They are also the cold region of the earth.
- Find the latitude of you location. For example, Kyoto's latitude is 35.0116° N. So it is not in the tropics. The latitude of Mumbai, India is 19.0760° N. So it is in the tropics.
- You can learn about the latitude of earth from this [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PllX2YOAHo)
- The tropical ecosystem is home to a wide variety of plant and animal species, many of which are not found in other types of ecosystems. 
- The tropical ecosystem is also characterized by its high levels of biodiversity, which means that it has a large number of different species living in it. 
- I also recommend students to see this [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vijLre760w) to understand the tropical ecosystem.

## Population

- The population is a group of individuals of the same species that live in the same area at the same time.
- A population is defined as a group of individuals of the same species living and interbreeding within a given area.
- Members of a population often rely on the same resources, are subject to similar environmental constraints, and depend on the availability of other members to persist over time. 
- We study a population by examining how individuals in that population interact with each other and how the population as a whole interacts with its environment.
- As a tool for objectively studying populations, population ecologists rely on a series of statistical measures, known as demographic parameters, to describe that population.
- The field of science interested in collecting and analyzing these numbers is termed population demographics, also known as demography.

I strongly recommend students to watch the following [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaOe_pBEgSE) to understand the concept of population.

- Population dynamics is an very intriguing subject. I can recommend the following article to understand the concept of population in an ecosystem.
