  abstract = {Carbohydrates provide the building blocks for plant structures as well as versatile resources for metabolic processes. The nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC), mainly sugars and starch, fulfil distinct functional roles, including transport, energy metabolism and osmoregulation, and provide substrates for the synthesis of defence compounds or exchange with symbionts involved in nutrient acquisition or defence. At the whole-plant level, NSC storage buffers the asynchrony of supply and demand on diel, seasonal or decadal temporal scales and across plant organs. Despite its central role in plant function and in stand-level carbon cycling, our understanding of storage dynamics, its controls and response to environmental stresses is very limited, even after a century of research. This reflects the fact that often storage is defined by what we can measure, that is, NSC concentrations, and the interpretation of these as a proxy for a single function, storage, rather than the outcome of a range of NSC source and sink functions. New isotopic tools allow direct quantification of timescales involved in NSC dynamics, and show that NSC-C fixed years to decades previously is used to support tree functions. Here we review recent advances, with emphasis on the context of the interactions between NSC, drought and tree mortality. Contents Summary 386 I. Introduction 386 II.

  abstract = {In the study, the influence of stand density on quantitative and morphological parameters of fine roots with the diameter less than 2 mm was analysed. The results confirmed the differences of the fine root distributions and the total fine root mass between stands with different density. The Norway spruce stand with lower stem density has a lower overall fine root mass but, at the same time, a higher fine root mass regarding the single tree. In the litter (Ol, Of-horizons), the fine roots are present only in the plot with higher density. The cumulative proportion of fine root biomass in the layer 0-10 cm reaches 67\% in the plot with lower density and 78\% in the plot with higher density. In the lower density plot, a lower proportion of fine roots in the diameter class under 0.25 mm was found in all analysed parameters. Specific root length, root surface area and root tissue density reflect the different diameter structure of fine roots in the surveyed plots. We suppose the stand density significantly affects the fine root system, especially by the change of moisture regime in the litter and in the upper parts of the A-horizon. Despite the high fine root dynamics of single trees, the Norway spruce stand with the lower stem density is not able to effectively utilize the entire soil space.},

  abstract = {Whilst the relationships between growth strategies and leaf traits are well established in functional plant ecology, little attention has been paid to root traits in very deep soil layers. The objective of our study was to compare the vertical velocity of the above- and belowground exploration of the environment for one of the fastest-growing tree species. Fine roots were studied in a chronosequence of intensively-managed Eucalyptus plantations established on highly weathered soils. Here we show that the root front depth was accurately predicted at 85\% of mean tree height for stands {$<$}20 m in height, in the absence of any physical or chemical barrier. Tree height and root front growth velocities peaked at 0.59 and 0.55 m month−1 respectively 9–10 months after planting, and decreased steadily thereafter. Fast root front displacement might provide a competitive advantage to fast-growing species in forests established on deep soils. Our study may contribute to the debate on the environmental impact of short-rotation plantation forests in the Tropics.},

  abstract = {Mycorrhizas are among the most important biological interkingdom interactions, as they involve \textasciitilde 340,000 land plants and \textasciitilde 50,000 taxa of soil fungi. In these mutually beneficial interactions, fungi receive photosynthesis-derived carbon and provide the host plant with mineral nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen in exchange. More than 150 years of research on mycorrhizas has raised awareness of their biology, biodiversity and ecological impact. In this Review, we focus on recent phylogenomic, molecular and cell biology studies to present the current state of knowledge of the origin of mycorrhizal fungi and the evolutionary history of their relationship with land plants. As mycorrhizas feature a variety of phenotypes, depending on partner taxonomy, physiology and cellular interactions, we explore similarities and differences between mycorrhizal types. During evolution, mycorrhizal fungi have refined their biotrophic capabilities to take advantage of their hosts as food sources and protective niches, while plants have developed multiple strategies to accommodate diverse fungal symbionts. Intimate associations with pervasive ecological success have originated at the crossroads between these two evolutionary pathways. Our understanding of the biological processes underlying these symbioses, where fungi act as biofertilizers and bioprotectors, provides the tools to design biotechnological applications addressing environmental and agricultural challenges.},

  abstract = {The classic model of nitrogen (N) flux into roots is as a Michaelis–Menten (MM) function of soil-N concentration at root surfaces. Furthermore, soil-N transport processes that determine soil-N concentration at root surfaces are seen as a bottleneck for plant nutrition. Yet, neither the MM relationship nor soil-N transport mechanisms are represented in current terrestrial biosphere models. Processes governing N supply to roots – diffusion, mass flow, N immobilization by soil microbes – are incorporated in a model of root-N uptake. We highlight a seldom considered interaction between these processes: nutrient traverses the rhizosphere more quickly in the presence of mass flow, reducing the probability of its immobilization before reaching the root surface. Root-N uptake is sensitive to the rate of mass flow for widely spaced roots with high N uptake capacity, but not for closely spaced roots or roots with low uptake capacity. The results point to a benefit of root switching from high- to low-affinity N transport systems in the presence of mass flow. Simulations indicate a strong impact of soil water uptake on N delivery to widely spaced roots through transpirationally driven mass flow. Furthermore, a given rate of N uptake per unit soil volume may be achieved by lower root biomass in the presence of mass flow.},

  abstract = {Plants, as sessile organisms, have evolved a remarkable developmental plasticity to cope with their changing environment. When growing in hostile desert conditions, plants have to grow and thrive in heat and drought. This review discusses how desert plants have adapted their root system architecture (RSA) to cope with scarce water availability and poor nutrient availability in the desert soil. First, we describe how some species can survive by developing deep tap roots to access the groundwater while others produce shallow roots to exploit the short rain seasons and unpredictable rainfalls. Then, we discuss how desert plants have evolved unique developmental programs like having determinate meristems in the case of cacti while forming a branched and compact root system that allows efficient water uptake during wet periods. The remote germination mechanism in date palms is another example of developmental adaptation to survive in the dry and hot desert surface. Date palms have also designed non-gravitropic secondary roots, termed pneumatophores, to maximize water and nutrient uptake. Next, we highlight the distinct anatomical features developed by desert species in response to drought like narrow vessels, high tissue suberization, and air spaces within the root cortex tissue. Finally, we discuss the beneficial impact of the microbiome in promoting root growth in desert conditions and how these characteristics can be exploited to engineer resilient crops with a greater ability to deal with salinity induced by irrigation and with the increasing drought caused by global warming.},
