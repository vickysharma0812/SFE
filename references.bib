  abstract = {Carbohydrates provide the building blocks for plant structures as well as versatile resources for metabolic processes. The nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC), mainly sugars and starch, fulfil distinct functional roles, including transport, energy metabolism and osmoregulation, and provide substrates for the synthesis of defence compounds or exchange with symbionts involved in nutrient acquisition or defence. At the whole-plant level, NSC storage buffers the asynchrony of supply and demand on diel, seasonal or decadal temporal scales and across plant organs. Despite its central role in plant function and in stand-level carbon cycling, our understanding of storage dynamics, its controls and response to environmental stresses is very limited, even after a century of research. This reflects the fact that often storage is defined by what we can measure, that is, NSC concentrations, and the interpretation of these as a proxy for a single function, storage, rather than the outcome of a range of NSC source and sink functions. New isotopic tools allow direct quantification of timescales involved in NSC dynamics, and show that NSC-C fixed years to decades previously is used to support tree functions. Here we review recent advances, with emphasis on the context of the interactions between NSC, drought and tree mortality. Contents Summary 386 I. Introduction 386 II.

The results confirmed the differences of the fine root distributions and the total fine root mass between stands with different density. The Norway spruce stand with lower stem density has a lower overall fine root mass but, at the same time, a higher fine root mass regarding the single tree. In the litter (Ol, Of-horizons), the fine roots are present only in the plot with higher density. The cumulative proportion of fine root biomass in the layer 0-10 cm reaches 67\% in the plot with lower density and 78\% in the plot with higher density. In the lower density plot, a lower proportion of fine roots in the diameter class under 0.25 mm was found in all analysed parameters. Specific root length, root surface area and root tissue density reflect the different diameter structure of fine roots in the surveyed plots. We suppose the stand density significantly affects the fine root system, especially by the change of moisture regime in the litter and in the upper parts of the A-horizon. Despite the high fine root dynamics of single trees, the Norway spruce stand with the lower stem density is not able to effectively utilize the entire soil space.},

Fine roots were studied in a chronosequence of intensively-managed Eucalyptus plantations established on highly weathered soils. Here we show that the root front depth was accurately predicted at 85\% of mean tree height for stands {$<$}20 m in height, in the absence of any physical or chemical barrier. Tree height and root front growth velocities peaked at 0.59 and 0.55 m month−1 respectively 9–10 months after planting, and decreased steadily thereafter. Fast root front displacement might provide a competitive advantage to fast-growing species in forests established on deep soils.

In these mutually beneficial interactions, fungi receive photosynthesis-derived carbon and provide the host plant with mineral nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen in exchange. More than 150 years of research on mycorrhizas has raised awareness of their biology, biodiversity and ecological impact. In this Review, we focus on recent phylogenomic, molecular and cell biology studies to present the current state of knowledge of the origin of mycorrhizal fungi and the evolutionary history of their relationship with land plants. As mycorrhizas feature a variety of phenotypes, depending on partner taxonomy, physiology and cellular interactions, we explore similarities and differences between mycorrhizal types. During evolution, mycorrhizal fungi have refined their biotrophic capabilities to take advantage of their hosts as food sources and protective niches, while plants have developed multiple strategies to accommodate diverse fungal symbionts. Intimate associations with pervasive ecological success have originated at the crossroads between these two evolutionary pathways. Our understanding of the biological processes underlying these symbioses, where fungi act as biofertilizers and bioprotectors, provides the tools to design biotechnological applications addressing environmental and agricultural challenges.},

  abstract = {The classic model of nitrogen (N) flux into roots is as a Michaelis–Menten (MM) function of soil-N concentration at root surfaces. Furthermore, soil-N transport processes that determine soil-N concentration at root surfaces are seen as a bottleneck for plant nutrition. Yet, neither the MM relationship nor soil-N transport mechanisms are represented in current terrestrial biosphere models. Processes governing N supply to roots – diffusion, mass flow, N immobilization by soil microbes – are incorporated in a model of root-N uptake. We highlight a seldom considered interaction between these processes: nutrient traverses the rhizosphere more quickly in the presence of mass flow, reducing the probability of its immobilization before reaching the root surface. Root-N uptake is sensitive to the rate of mass flow for widely spaced roots with high N uptake capacity, but not for closely spaced roots or roots with low uptake capacity. The results point to a benefit of root switching from high- to low-affinity N transport systems in the presence of mass flow. Simulations indicate a strong impact of soil water uptake on N delivery to widely spaced roots through transpirationally driven mass flow. Furthermore, a given rate of N uptake per unit soil volume may be achieved by lower root biomass in the presence of mass flow.},

  abstract = {Plants, as sessile organisms, have evolved a remarkable developmental plasticity to cope with their changing environment. When growing in hostile desert conditions, plants have to grow and thrive in heat and drought. This review discusses how desert plants have adapted their root system architecture (RSA) to cope with scarce water availability and poor nutrient availability in the desert soil. First, we describe how some species can survive by developing deep tap roots to access the groundwater while others produce shallow roots to exploit the short rain seasons and unpredictable rainfalls. Then, we discuss how desert plants have evolved unique developmental programs like having determinate meristems in the case of cacti while forming a branched and compact root system that allows efficient water uptake during wet periods. The remote germination mechanism in date palms is another example of developmental adaptation to survive in the dry and hot desert surface. Date palms have also designed non-gravitropic secondary roots, termed pneumatophores, to maximize water and nutrient uptake. Next, we highlight the distinct anatomical features developed by desert species in response to drought like narrow vessels, high tissue suberization, and air spaces within the root cortex tissue. Finally, we discuss the beneficial impact of the microbiome in promoting root growth in desert conditions and how these characteristics can be exploited to engineer resilient crops with a greater ability to deal with salinity induced by irrigation and with the increasing drought caused by global warming.},

  abstract = {Quercus suber (cork oak tree) is an excellent epicormic resprouter that can keep cambium alive after high-intensity fires because of its plan traits, mainly its thick cork. Although tree bark harvesting is an important source of income, it may reduce protection against wildfires. This study aims to identify stem and cork characteristics that affect the probability of reaching lethal cambial temperature and hence the probability of survival of living tissues. Cork flammability was analyzed using a sample set comprised of 120 cork specimens and 120 cork pieces. Five experimental fires were used to test the results obtained at bench scale. Bench-scale flammability experiments could not simulate the real heat spread and presence of highly volatile isoprenoids. The results revealed differences in cambial temperature and lethal temperature rate (LTR) at both scales according to corkback roughness and cork quality. Peak cambial temperature and LTR show an increase in stems characterized by maximum roughness and worse cork quality. The LTR measurements showed a 30\% difference between bench and field scales (0.35\,mm\,s−1 and 0.5\,mm\,s−1, respectively). The findings indicate that corkback roughness, cork thickness, cork porosity and cork quality could influence the vulnerability of cork oak forests to wildfires. A negative correlation was found between total thickness and cambial temperature. A total thickness of over 3.7\,cm prevented reaching lethal cambial temperature. Forest managers can use this information to define silviculture and design forest treatments with a view to reducing fire severity and mitigating the ecological and socioeconomic impacts of fire in cork oak forests.},

The establishment and persistence of riparian cottonwood (Populus spp.) seedlings depends largely on water availability, but this does not preclude an important role for nutrient availability. To investigate how nitrogen availability may influence the composition and productivity of riparian communities, we tested the hypothesis that the growth and survival of first-year Fremont cottonwood seedlings is limited by the availability of both water and nitrogen. Plots of naturally germinated cottonwood seedlings along the Yampa River in Northwest Colorado were randomly assigned one of four treatments: control, water, nitrogen, or water plus nitrogen. Additions of nitrogen or water doubled total (root plus shoot) seedling and shoot length. Water additions did not increase root growth, while N addition doubled the root extension of first-year cottonwood seedlings. The water-plus-nitrogen treatment doubled total seedling and root length, and tripled shoot length. Additions of water or nitrogen also more then doubled cottonwood seedling survival through the first growing season. This co-limitation of cottonwood germinants by both water and nitrogen suggests that the productivity and species composition of riparian vegetation may need to be examined in relation to supplies of resources other than water.},

Although vertical LMA gradients in forests have historically been attributed to a direct phenotypic response to light, an increasing number of recent studies have provided evidence that water limitation in the upper canopy can constrain foliar morphological adaptations to higher light levels. We measured height, light, and LMA of all species encountered along 45 vertical canopy transects across a Costa Rican tropical rain forest. LMA was correlated with light levels in the lower canopy until approximately 18 m sample height and 22\% diffuse transmittance. Height showed a remarkably linear relationship with LMA throughout the entire vertical canopy profile for all species pooled and for each functional group individually (except epiphytes), possibly through the influence of gravity on leaf water potential and turgor pressure. Models of forest function may be greatly simplified by estimating LMA-correlated leaf physiological parameters solely from foliage height profiles, which in turn can be assessed with satellite- and aircraft-based remote sensing.},

Some models predict heights of up to 120\,m in the absence of mechanical damage3,4, but there are historical accounts of taller trees5. Current hypotheses of height limitation focus on increasing water transport constraints in taller trees and the resulting reductions in leaf photosynthesis6. We studied redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens), including the tallest known tree on Earth (112.7\,m), in wet temperate forests of northern California. Our regression analyses of height gradients in leaf functional characteristics estimate a maximum tree height of 122–130\,m barring mechanical damage, similar to the tallest recorded trees of the past. As trees grow taller, increasing leaf water stress due to gravity and path length resistance may ultimately limit leaf expansion and photosynthesis for further height growth, even with ample soil moisture.},

Current-year shoots were sampled from upper canopy positions in five stands, ranging in height from 1.8 to 33.0 m (corresponding age range was 10--85 years). A/Ci curves were determined to obtain maximum carboxylation rates (Vcmax) and maximum rates of electron transport (Jmax). Needle nitrogen (N) partitioning into photosynthetic functions was calculated from the values of Vcmax, Jmax and leaf chlorophyll concentration. All needle size parameters (length, width, thickness, volume and cross-sectional areas of mesophyll and xylem) increased significantly with tree height. The needles of taller trees had lower mass-based N and chlorophyll concentrations (21\% and 43\% difference between shortest and tallest stands, respectively), but higher dry mass per area (35\%), dry mass per volume (18\%), number of cells per mesophyll cross-section area (40\%) and partitioning of N into non-photosynthetic functions (12\%). Light saturated net assimilation rate, Vcmax, Jmax and stomatal conductance decreased with tree age (35\%, 16\%, 12\% and 29\% difference, respectively). A path analysis model describing tree age-related reduction of photosynthetic capacity as a result of sink limitation provided the best fit to our data. However, since the path model corresponding to source limitation, where photosynthetic reduction derives from changes in needle structure and chemistry was not rejected, we conclude that the decline in photosynthesis with tree age results from several mechanisms (limited sink strength, stomatal and N limitation) operating simultaneously and sequentially.},

We offer examples of how this new type of data set can serve ecological science, land management, and environmental policy. To enhance the use of these data by nonspecialists, we are now producing monthly anomaly maps for GPP and annual NPP that compare the current value with an 18-year average value for each pixel, clearly identifying regions where vegetation growth is higher or lower than normal.},

  abstract = {Aim We sought to determine the relationship of forest composition and alpha diversity (the species diversity of a local assemblage) to altitude, soil, and spatial factors over a 440–2,950 m a.s.l gradient. Location Altitudinal gradient on the Caribbean slope of the Talamanca Cordillera, Costa Rica. Taxon Angiosperm and gymnosperm trees, palms, and tree ferns. Methods We measured and identified all stems ≥10 cm dbh in 32 0.25-ha undisturbed rain forest plots over the gradient. We determined compositional patterns using Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS) ordination, and used linear regressions to explore the relationship between four alpha diversity metrics and altitude. With variation partitioning (VARPART), we determined the compositional variation explained by altitude, soil, and spatial variables quantified using Principle Components of Neighbor matrices. Results We identified 425 species. NMS axis 1 separated a lowland zone (440–1,120 m asl) from a transitional one dominated by holarctic Oreomunnea mexicana (1,400–1,600 m asl) and Quercus-dominated forests at altitudes {$>$}2,100 m asl. The lowland zone was separated into two clusters of plots on NMS axis 2, the first in the 430–620 m asl range and the second at 1,000–1,120 masl. Regressions showed that all alpha diversity metrics were strongly negatively related to altitude (R2 {$>$} 0.78). Overall, adjusted R2 from VARPART was 0.43, with 0.30, 0.21, and 0.17 for altitude, soil, and space respectively. The respective adjusted R2 of individual matrices, on controlling for the other two, was 0.06, 0.05 and 0.09 (p {$<$} 0.001). Main conclusions There are two well-defined forest compositional zones on this gradient—lowlands 430–1,120 m asl and montane forests {$>$}2,150 m asl—with a transitional zone at 1,400–1,600 m asl, where lowland tropical and montane holarctic species are found together. Montane forests are very distinct in their composition and low alpha diversity. Vegetation and soil respond to altitude, and therefore temperature, as an integrated system, a model that goes beyond niche assembly as shown by the significant effect of space in the VARPART.},

  abstract = {The increase of biodiversity from poles to equator is one of the most pervasive features of nature. For 2 centuries since von Humboldt, Wallace, and Darwin, biogeographers and ecologists have investigated the environmental and historical factors that determine the latitudinal gradient of species diversity, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. The recently proposed metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) aims to explain ecological patterns and processes, including geographical patterns of species richness, in terms of the effects of temperature and body size on the metabolism of organisms. Here we use 2 comparable databases of tree distributions in eastern Asia and North America to investigate the roles of environmental temperature and spatial scale in shaping geographical patterns of species diversity. We find that number of species increases exponentially with environmental temperature as predicted by the MTE, and so does the rate of spatial turnover in species composition (slope of the species-area relationship). The magnitude of temperature dependence of species richness increases with spatial scale. Moreover, the relationship between species richness and temperature is much steeper in eastern Asia than in North America: in cold climates at high latitudes there are more tree species in North America, but the reverse is true in warmer climates at lower latitudes. These patterns provide evidence that the kinetics of ecological and evolutionary processes play a major role in the latitudinal pattern of biodiversity.},

  abstract = {We review the current understanding of the temperature responses of C3 and C4 photosynthesis across thermal ranges that do not harm the photosynthetic apparatus. In C3 species, photosynthesis is classically considered to be limited by the capacities of ribulose 1·5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration or Pi regeneration. Using both theoretical and empirical evidence, we describe the temperature response of instantaneous net CO2 assimilation rate (A) in terms of these limitations, and evaluate possible limitations on A at elevated temperatures arising from heat-induced lability of Rubisco activase. In C3 plants, Rubisco capacity is the predominant limitation on A across a wide range of temperatures at low CO2 ({$<$}300 µbar), while at elevated CO2, the limitation shifts to Pi regeneration capacity at suboptimal temperatures, and either electron transport capacity or Rubisco activase capacity at supraoptimal temperatures. In C4 plants, Rubisco capacity limits A below 20 °C in chilling-tolerant species, but the control over A at elevated temperature remains uncertain. Acclimation of C3 photosynthesis to suboptimal growth temperature is commonly associated with a disproportional enhancement of the Pi regeneration capacity. Above the thermal optimum, acclimation of A to increasing growth temperature is associated with increased electron transport capacity and/or greater heat stability of Rubisco activase. In many C4 species from warm habitats, acclimation to cooler growth conditions increases levels of Rubisco and C4 cycle enzymes which then enhance A below the thermal optimum. By contrast, few C4 species adapted to cooler habitats increase Rubisco content during acclimation to reduced growth temperature; as a result, A changes little at suboptimal temperatures. Global change is likely to cause a widespread shift in patterns of photosynthetic limitation in higher plants. Limitations in electron transport and Rubisco activase capacity should be more common in the warmer, high CO2 conditions expected by the end of the century.},

  abstract = {Tropical forests contribute significantly to the global carbon cycle, but little is known about the temperature response of photosynthetic carbon uptake in tropical species, and how this varies within and across forests. We determined in situ photosynthetic temperature–response curves for upper canopy leaves of 42 tree and liana species from two tropical forests in Panama with contrasting rainfall regimes. On the basis of seedling studies, we hypothesized that species with high photosynthetic capacity – light-demanding, fast-growing species – would have a higher temperature optimum of photosynthesis (TOpt) than species with low photosynthetic capacity – shade-tolerant, slow-growing species – and that, therefore, TOpt would scale with the position of a species on the slow–fast continuum of plant functional traits. TOpt was remarkably similar across species, regardless of their photosynthetic capacity and other plant functional traits. Community-average TOpt was almost identical to mean maximum daytime temperature, which was higher in the dry forest. Photosynthesis above TOpt appeared to be more strongly limited by stomatal conductance in the dry forest than in the wet forest. The observation that all species in a community shared similar TOpt values suggests that photosynthetic performance is optimized under current temperature regimes. These results should facilitate the scaling up of photosynthesis in relation to temperature from leaf to stand level in species-rich tropical forests.},

  abstract = {Most plants show considerable capacity to adjust their photosynthetic characteristics to their growth temperatures (temperature acclimation). The most typical case is a shift in the optimum temperature for photosynthesis, which can maximize the photosynthetic rate at the growth temperature. These plastic adjustments can allow plants to photosynthesize more efficiently at their new growth temperatures. In this review article, we summarize the basic differences in photosynthetic reactions in C3, C4, and CAM plants. We review the current understanding of the temperature responses of C3, C4, and CAM photosynthesis, and then discuss the underlying physiological and biochemical mechanisms for temperature acclimation of photosynthesis in each photosynthetic type. Finally, we use the published data to evaluate the extent of photosynthetic temperature acclimation in higher plants, and analyze which plant groups (i.e., photosynthetic types and functional types) have a greater inherent ability for photosynthetic acclimation to temperature than others, since there have been reported interspecific variations in this ability. We found that the inherent ability for temperature acclimation of photosynthesis was different: (1) among C3, C4, and CAM species; and (2) among functional types within C3 plants. C3 plants generally had a greater ability for temperature acclimation of photosynthesis across a broad temperature range, CAM plants acclimated day and night photosynthetic process differentially to temperature, and C4 plants was adapted to warm environments. Moreover, within C3 species, evergreen woody plants and perennial herbaceous plants showed greater temperature homeostasis of photosynthesis (i.e., the photosynthetic rate at high-growth temperature divided by that at low-growth temperature was close to 1.0) than deciduous woody plants and annual herbaceous plants, indicating that photosynthetic acclimation would be particularly important in perennial, long-lived species that would experience a rise in growing season temperatures over their lifespan. Interestingly, across growth temperatures, the extent of temperature homeostasis of photosynthesis was maintained irrespective of the extent of the change in the optimum temperature for photosynthesis (T opt), indicating that some plants achieve greater photosynthesis at the growth temperature by shifting T opt, whereas others can also achieve greater photosynthesis at the growth temperature by changing the shape of the photosynthesis–temperature curve without shifting T opt. It is considered that these differences in the inherent stability of temperature acclimation of photosynthesis would be reflected by differences in the limiting steps of photosynthetic rate.},

We reviewed and analysed the responses of photosynthesis and respiration to warming in 101 evergreen species from boreal to tropical biomes. Summertime temperatures affected both latitudinal gas exchange rates and the degree of responsiveness to experimental warming. The decrease in net photosynthesis at 25°C (Anet25) was larger with warming in tropical climates than cooler ones. Respiration at 25°C (R25) was reduced by 14\% in response to warming across species and biomes. Gymnosperms were more sensitive to greater amounts of warming than broadleaved evergreens, with Anet25 and R25 reduced c. 30–40\% with {$>$} 10°C warming. While standardised rates of carboxylation (Vcmax25) and electron transport (Jmax25) adjusted to warming, the magnitude of this adjustment was not related to warming amount (range 0.6–16°C). The temperature optimum of photosynthesis (ToptA) increased on average 0.34°C per °C warming. The combination of more constrained acclimation of photosynthesis and increasing respiration rates with warming could possibly result in a reduced carbon sink in future warmer climates. The predictable patterns of thermal acclimation across biomes provide a strong basis to improve modelling predictions of the future terrestrial carbon sink with warming.},

  abstract = {Forest canopies play a major role in biosphere—atmosphere interaction. Their actual temperature may deviate substantially from ambient atmospheric conditions as reported by weather stations. While there is a long tradition of false-colour imagery, new digital technologies in combination with IR transmission lenses and autocalibration routines permit unprecedented insight into the actual temperature regimes in canopies. We report canopy leaf temperature distribution over space and time assessed over a 35m tall mixed deciduous forest in NW Switzerland by means of a construction crane and a high resolution thermal camera. At an air temperature of 25°C, conifers (Picea abies, Pinus sylverstris and Larix decidua) and deciduous broad-leaved trees with exceptionally high transpiration (Quercus petraea) or very open, low density canopies (Prunus avium) exhibited mean canopy leaf temperatures close to air temperature (0.3–2.7K above ambient) and the maximum amplitude within a given crown reached 6–9K. In contrast, broad-leaved deciduous species with dense canopies (Fagus sylvatica, Carpinus betulus and Tilia platyphyllos) were 4.5–5K warmer than air temperature and showed within canopy temperature amplitudes of 10–12K. Calculated leaf boundary resistance was clearly lower for conifers (3–24ms−1) than for broad-leaved trees (33–64ms−1). The study illustrates that mean leaf temperatures in forest trees are not adequately explained by either stomatal conductance or leaf dimensions, but strongly depend on canopy architecture (leaf area density, branching habits) in combination with leaf traits. Aerodynamic leaf and canopy characteristics lead to strongly enhanced vapour pressure gradients (evaporative forcing) and leaf temperatures vary enormously over short distances, calling for statistical temperature models (frequency distribution) rather than the use of means in any flux calculations. The presence/absence of certain tree taxa plays a key role in forest surface temperature.},
