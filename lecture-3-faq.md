## Chemical reactions (Redox, Exothermic, and Endothermic reactions)

Consider the following chemical reaction:

$$
A + B \rightarrow C + D
$$

where $A$ and $B$ are reactants, and $C$ and $D$ are products.

### What is the difference between exothermic and endothermic reactions?

- **Exothermic reaction**: A chemical reaction that releases energy, usually in the form of heat. The products have lower energy than the reactants.
- **Endothermic reaction**: A chemical reaction that absorbs energy from its surroundings. The products have higher energy than the reactants.

Why energy is released or absorbed in a chemical reaction?

In any chemical reaction, some bonds are broken and new bonds are formed. Energy is required to break the bonds which we will call as bond dissociation energy. Also, energy is released when new bonds are formed, which will be referred to as the bond formation energy.

- A reaction is exotermic if the bond formation energy is greater than the bond dissociation energy.
- A reaction is endothermic if the bond dissociation energy is greater than the bond formation energy.

### What is a redox reaction?

In a chemical reaction the electrons cannot be created or destroyed, but they can be transferred from one atom to another. So the flow of electrons can only occur from a source connected to a sink. So what it means is that if in a chemical reaction electrons are flowing then someone should provide the electrons and someone should accept the electrons.

A redox reaction can be defined as a chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred between two reactants participating in it.

I have updated the lecture notes to improve the description of redox reactions in the context of forest ecology. Please refer to the updated notes for a more detailed explanation.

## Photon energy $E=h\nu$

- Photons are discrete packets of light energy. Visible light, X-rays, ultraviolet, infrared, microwaves, and radio waves all consist of photons differing in energy (frequency).
- A photon's energy is proportional to the frequency of the electromagnetic wave:

$$
E = h \nu
$$

where $E$ is the energy of the photon, $h$ is Planck's constant ($6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{J s}$), and $\nu$ is the frequency of the electromagnetic wave.

::: {.callout-note title="wave-particle duality"}
During the 19th and early 20th centuries, light was found to behave as a wave then later was discovered to have a particle-like behavior, whereas electrons behaved like particles in early experiments then were later discovered to have wave-like behavior. The concept of duality arose to name these seeming contradictions.

## Why do we see colors?

::: {.callout-note title="Color perception"}

Light is a form of electromagnetic wave. It contains several frequencies (or wavelengths). We often call it spectrum. The visible spectrum contains wavelength from 380 to 780 nano meters. The red color has the biggest wavelength in the visible spectrum.
:::

Every object smaller or bigger absorbs and reflects light. What it means is that the object absorbs certain wavelengths and reflects certain wavelength. The wavelength that object absorbs never reaches to our eyes, but the reflected wave lengths are received by our eyes. Therefore, we see the color corresponding to the wavelengths that have been reflected from the object.
