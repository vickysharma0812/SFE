## Learning Objectives

- Siviculture basics

## Stand

A **stand** is defined as the smallest unit of forest mapping that can be defined as a spatial area where a group of trees is more or less homogeneous in regard to

- species composition
- density
- age-class distribution.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" }
The internal structure of stands contains trees of different species and age
:::

> From the view point of forest management the term "forest" denotes a collection of stands that are managed together.

> We seek sustained yield of products from the forest, not the stand.

## Stand dynamics

- A forest stand is dynamic and changes over time.
- Stand dynamics is the study of changes in forest stand structure over time.
  - How stand behaves after disturbances
- It is important to predict what kind of vegetation will follow regenerative disturbances
- What pattern of develpment will occur in the vegetation as the stand grows older.

## Silviculture is understanding disturbances in forest

- All silvicultural procedures are, at least to some degree, simulations of natural processes in which stands
  - start $\rightarrow$ develop $\rightarrow$ replaced (gradually or suddenly).

- Plants can only begin growing or speed up their growth when another organism dies, creating space for them to develop.
- Mature plants often crowd out smaller ones by growing larger, slowing their growth, or eliminating weaker plants.
- Some plants can endure beneath taller neighbors and thus share growing space with them.

## Natural disturbances

- **Fire**:  fire that can be said to *“kill from the bottom up”* because they are more likely to kill small plants than large.
  - It is leathal to groundstory plants.
- Wind and insects: windstorms or pests that kill more large trees than small trees,
  - and thus *“kill from the top down"*.
  - They have been categorized as "release".
  - Because these disturbances destroy the upper canopy but allow the release of the understory.

## Stages of stand development

- First stage: Stand initiation
- Second stage: Stem exclusion
- Third stage: Understory reinitiation
- Fourth stage: Old-growth stage

## First stage: Stand initiation

- After a disturbance creates open space, new trees don't immediately fill it.
- This leaves room for other plants to grow.
- Often, short-lived plants like annual herbs temporarily occupy these empty spaces.

![Stand initialisation source The practice of silviculture by Ashton and Kelty](./figures/lecture-11-stem-init.png)

## Second stage: Stem exclusion

::::{.columns}

::: {.column width=50%}

- In the end, both the space above and below the ground gets filled with plants, mostly trees and shrubs in forests.
- The trees grow so close together that their branches touch, causing the lower leaves to die from lack of sunlight.
- During stem exclusion stage, the trees start to compete with each other;
  - the more vigorous ones encroach into the growing space of weaker trees that eventually die
  - The weaker trees die usually from lack of light or soil moisture, in a process called suppression.

::: {.column width=50%}

![Stem exclusion, source: The practice of silviculture by Ashton and Kelty](./figures/lecture-11-stem-exclusion.png)

:::

::::

## Third stage: Understory reinitiation stage

- In this stage, successful trees start to die due to pests, damage, or being cut down.
- The gaps created allow new plants to grow underneath.
  - These new plants are often young trees of species that can grow in shade.

![Understory reinitiation stage source: The practice of silviculture by Ashton and Kelty](./figures/lecture-11-stem-reinit.png)

## Fourth stage: Old-growth stage

- This stage begins when most of the old trees have died and younger trees form part of the top canopy.
- More trees of different ages appear, but a balanced mix of tree ages is unlikely without deliberate cutting.
- Many dead trees remain standing or fallen on the ground.

## Stand development process

The stand develpment process:

- Starts with the birth of the stand
- Continue with comptetition among trees
- Ends with the death of old trees and their replacement.

## Rotation period

::::{.columns}

::: {.column width=50%}

The **rotation period** is the time between the establishment of a stand and its final harvest.

- Teak grown for harvesting: from the sowing stage to the point where the rate of growth of the teak trees has slowed down or stopped such that it is considered economically a better option to fell the trees.
- Rotation period is the Average age at which a tree is considered mature for felling

## Diameter at Breast Height (DBH)

Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) is a standard method of measuring the diameter of a tree trunk at 1.3 meters (4.5 feet) above ground level. It is commonly used in forestry to assess tree size and volume.

![DBH measurement](./figures/lecture-10-dbh.png)

## Age-Class distribution of stands

- Foresters need to know the age of trees in a forest, especially when trees started growing at different times.
- This helps them plan when to cut trees and predict how the forest will grow in the future.
- The terms cohort and age class are used for dating the ages of stands.

- Even-age stands
- Uneven-age stands
- Multi-age age stands

## Even-age stands

::::{.columns}

::: {.column width=50%}

- These are the simplest kind of stand development
- Trees growing within the stand have only small differences in their ages: It means that all trees almost starts together afer the previous stand is removed.
- These stands generally contains trees of single species.
- The difference in age is usually less than 20% of the rotation age.

## Even-aged stands

![Even-aged stand, Source: The practice of silviculture by Ashton and Kelty](./figures/lecture-10-even-aged-2.png){.lightbox}

- Even-though the age is same, the DBH of the trees can be different (due to site quality and competition)
- Although it might seem that fat trees are always older than thin ones, diameter is not a very good criterion of age and must be used as such with caution.
- The diameter growth of trees is much more variable than that in height

## Even-age stand dynamics

::::{.columns}

::: {.column width=50%}

- They usually appear in nature after deadly events like severe fires or, artificially, from land clearing and replanting programs.
- The species composition remains pure only when extreme conditions (like soil moisture) prevent multiple species from surviving.
- During the stem exclusion stage, trees in pure stands compete strongly with each other because their crowns are at the same height.
- A pure stand typically begins with many small trees (thousands per acre/hectare).

## Even-age stand dynamics

::::{.columns}

::: {.column width=50%}

- As trees grow larger, their numbers decrease—quickly at first, then more slowly over decades.
- By the understory reinitiation stage, only a few hundred or fewer than 100 trees remain per acre (hectare).
- This continual reduction in numbers happens because trees compete for resources, following a basic rule of forest management.
- The strongest trees that grow best in their environment usually survive the intense competition for light, water, and nutrients.
- Growing tall is the most important factor in this competition.

## Even-aged stand dynamics

::::{.columns}

::: {.column width=50%}

- The tallest trees are usually the largest in all ways, especially in crown (top) size.
- As weaker trees get crowded by taller ones, their crowns become smaller and misshapen.
- Unless something removes the surrounding trees, these weaker ones eventually get completely shaded and die.
- In this ongoing process, the weaker trees in an age group gradually fall behind, while the strongest push ahead.

## Even-aged stand dynamics

::::{.columns}

::: {.column width=50%}

- Very few trees can regain a leading position once they've fallen behind in the race upward.
- This process is called **crown differentiation**.
- The relative positions of tree crowns in this process can be sorted into classes.
- Five crown classes are commonly recognized. This way of classifying tree crowns is called the Kraft Crown Classification, named after the 19th-century German forester who created it.
- It only works for forests with one tree species, or for forests with different species that grow in height at the same rate.

## Kraft Crown Classification

- **Emergent**: trees with crowns extending well ABOVE the **general level of the canopy**
  - So much so that the bottom of the crown is above the canopy.
- **Dominant**: trees with crowns extending above the **general level of the crown cover
  - They receive full light from above and partly from the sides
  - These trees are larger than the average trees in the stands

## Kraft Crown Classification

- **Codominant**: trees with crowns forming the **general level of canopy**
  - They receive full light from above but comparatively little from the sides;
  - usually with medium‐sized crowns more or less crowded on the sides.

![Kraft Crown Classification, Source: openoregon.pressbooks.pub](https://openoregon.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/4.4and4.7-1024x847.png){.lightbox width=50%}

## Kraft Crown Classification

- **Intermediate**: trees shorter than dominant and codominant class.
  - The crowns extends into the crown cover, formed by codominant and dominant trees
  - They receive little direct light from above but none from the sides
  - usually with small crowns considerably crowded on the sides.

## Kraft Crown Classification

- **Overtopped**: trees with crowns entirely below the general level of the crown cover,
  - receiving no direct light either from above or from the sides. Synonym: “suppressed.”

## Uneven-aged stands

- **All-aged stands** are those that contain trees of different ages, often with a wide range of age classes.
- **Multi-aged stands** are those that contain trees with two or three distinct age classes.
- The uneven-aged stands can be balance or unbalanced
- They can be single-species or multi-species stands.

## Single species, three-aged stands (unbalanced)

![Multi-aged stand, Source: The practice of silviculture by Ashton and Kelty](./figures/lecture-10-uneven-aged-3.png)

- Uneven‐aged stand, single species, unbalanced: they are revealed as humps on the diameter distribution curve.
- Natural fires may create such stands
- They can be pure or mixed species stands

## Single species, all-aged stands

![Uneven-aged stand, Source: The practice of silviculture by Ashton and Kelty](./figures/lecture-10-uneven-aged-2.png)

- How does such a stand develop naturally?
- When small gaps form in forests due to cutting or damage, new trees can start growing in these openings.
- Small pure groups of trees in uneven-aged stands develop similarly to even-aged stands
- One species that is more resilient to the forest fire can start to dominate the stand.

## Single species, all-aged stands

- These stands typically exist in areas where dry soil or occasional fires limit growth to just one tree species.
- Many ponderosa pine forests in the western interior show this pattern
- Most all-aged stands actually contain multiple species.
- Managing forests with trees of different ages is challenging, especially when aiming for steady wood production.
- Foresters often adjust tree sizes to create specific patterns.

## Single aged, stratified mixtures

::::{.columns}

::: {.column width=50%}

- Stratified mixtures develop differently than simple pure even-aged stands.
- Trees grow to different heights, forming distinct layers or stories in the forest canopy.
- Each layer typically contains one species or similar species.

## Single aged, stratified mixtures

::::{.columns}

::: {.column width=50%}

- The sorting into strata starts early when the forest begins growing and becomes most obvious when trees crowd together.
- Trees compete most strongly with similar trees in the same layer.
- Lower tree layers survive alongside upper ones.
- Species in lower layers are adapted to live there without trying to reach the top.
- Species that were tall in previous forests usually grow tall again, even if this happens later when the forest becomes crowded.

Two different categorizations of forest strata. 

- (a) A single‐aged, mixed‐species, stratified stand showing four strata: 
  - A – canopy
  - B – subcanopy
  - C – understory
  - D – groundstory.
- (b) A second‐growth tropical rainforest as an example of a single‐aged mixture with the following strata: emergent, canopy, under canopy, and shrub layer

## Stand structural objectives

- To maintain or create a forest stand of certain age-class structure
- **Even-aged management** is particularly suitable when Timber production is a primary objective or when operational efficiency is prioritized over structural diversity.
  - Uniform growth rates make planning and operations more predictable
  - Standardized silvicultural treatments can be applied across the entire stand
  - Concentrated harvesting reduces operational costs
  - Higher volume yield per area during harvest
  - More consistent wood quality and product dimensions
  - Creates optimal growing conditions for desired species with similar growth requirements

## Stand structural objectives

**Uneven-aged forest**

- Useful when we are managing forests for the purpose of wildlife or promoting biodiversity.
- Young saplings provide food for herbivores and old snag trees provide shelter to many birds
- More robust against pests, diseases, and climate fluctuations
- Reduced risk of catastrophic disturbances affecting the entire stand
- Creates a more regular cash flow rather than periodic large payments
- Continuous forest cover reduces soil erosion
- Better maintains water quality and regulates water flow
- Maintains more consistent carbon stocks over time
