    "text": "It is basically the auditing of water in the forest ecosystem. In this auditing we are concern with the sources by which water enters the forest ecosystem. We are also concerned with the processes by which water leaves the forest ecosystem.\n\n\n\nInterception is the amount of water that is stopped by the canopy of the trees and does not reach the ground. Canopy acts like a roof and stops the rain water from reaching the ground. With time this water evaporates back into the atmosphere. The effect of canopy on interception is discussed in the lecture notes. But let me summarize it here.\n\nIf the canopy is dense, it will have less holes and more water will be intercepted.\nIf number of layers of leaves in canopy is more, then also more water will be intercepted.\nIF the leaves of the canopy are broader and flatter, then also more water will be intercepted.\n\nIn addition, the region of high rainfall will have more interception than the region of low rainfall. This is because in high rainfall region, the canopy will be wet for longer time and therefore more water will evaporate back into the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nWhen water reaches the ground, a part of it is absorbed by the soil particles (this is called bounded water). The rest of the water flows over the other region of the ground. The total amount of water that enters the soil (absorbed water + moving water in soil) is called infiltration.\n\n\n\n\nFirst let us recall that the soil is made up of different mineral particles.\nIn addition, different soils have different size of particles.\nSmaller particles have more surface area\nClay minerals have very small particles, high surface area, and high negative charge on their surface. These particles have high water holding capacity due to the presence of clay minerals such as montmorillonite, illite, and kaolinite.\n\nNow let us try to understand why different soils have different holding capacity. This is because they have different amount of clay and organic matter. Even though clay have high water holding capacity. Different clay minerals have different water holding capacity. For example, montormillonite has higher water holding capacity than kaolinite.\n\n\n\nThe O horizon is the top layer of soil that contains organic matter. The water holding capacity of the organic matter is very high.\nSoil organic matter (SOM) has a high water retention capacity primarily due to its unique physical and chemical properties. It acts like a sponge, improving soil structure and directly holding onto water molecules. Soil organic matter enhances water retention through several interconnected mechanisms:\n\n\n\nPorous Structure and Increased Pore Space: Organic matter, especially well-decomposed humus, has a highly porous structure. This significantly increases the total pore space in the soil. These pores, particularly the smaller micropores, are crucial for holding water against the force of gravity, making it available for plant uptake.\nImproved Soil Aggregation: SOM acts as a binding agent, helping soil mineral particles (sand, silt, and clay) clump together to form stable aggregates. This improved soil structure creates a wider range of pore sizes:\n\nMacropores (larger pores between aggregates) facilitate water infiltration and drainage.\nMicropores (smaller pores within aggregates) are primarily responsible for storing water that plants can use.\n\nIncreased Surface Area: Organic matter particles, particularly humus, have a vast surface area relative to their size. This large surface area provides more sites for water molecules to adhere to.\nReduced Bulk Density: As organic matter content increases, the soil’s bulk density (weight per unit volume) generally decreases. This indicates a lighter, more porous soil with greater capacity to hold water.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdsorption and Absorption: Organic matter can adsorb water molecules onto its surfaces and absorb water into its internal structure. Humus, a key component of SOM, can hold up to 90% of its weight in water.\nHydrogen Bonding: Organic matter contains numerous functional groups (e.g., carboxyl, hydroxyl) that are polar. These groups can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules (\\(H_2O\\)). This chemical attraction helps the soil retain water more effectively.\nEnhanced Plant Available Water (PAW): Importantly, much of the water held by organic matter is in a form that is readily available to plants. While clay soils can hold a lot of water, a significant portion is held too tightly for plants to access. Organic matter increases the amount of water held between field capacity (the amount of water soil holds after excess has drained away) and the permanent wilting point (the point at which plants can no longer extract water). This is particularly beneficial in coarse-textured (sandy) soils, which naturally have low water holding capacity.\n\nIn essence, adding organic matter to soil improves its physical structure, creating more and better-sized pores, while its chemical nature allows it to attract and hold onto water molecules, ultimately leading to a greater capacity to store water that is accessible to plants."

    "text": "There are three types of rocks: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. The rock cycle describes how these rocks can change from one type to another over time.\n\nYou can find more information about the rock cycle here\nI have also made a document on the rock cycle, which you can find here\n\n\n\n\nThe double diffuse layer (DDL) is a two-layer structure that forms at the interface between a clay particle and the surrounding solution, primarily due to the clay’s negative charge. This layer plays a crucial role in understanding clay’s behavior in various soil and water systems.\n\nThe clay particle are very small (less than 2 micrometers) and have a large surface area.\nThe behavior of a single clay particle or assembly of several clay particles is many governed by the electrostatic forces between the clay particles and the surrounding solution.\nThe negative charge of the clay particle attracts hydrogen ions (H+) and cations (positively charged ions) from the surrounding solution, forming a double diffuse layer.\nThe first layer, known as the Stern layer, is tightly bound to the clay particle and consists of cations and water molecules.\nThe second layer, known as the diffuse layer, is more loosely bound and contains a mix of cations and anions (negatively charged ions).\n\n\n\n\nEven though rocks look hard and solid, some of them can react to acid. That is why we often perform acid tests on rocks to identify them. Pleas see the following video which explains the procedure of acid test on rocks.\n\n\nIn nature, the rocks can come into contact with the acid in several ways. For example, the rain water contains CO2 dissolved in water which makes it slightly acidic. This is called carbonic acid. Some organic acids are also produced by the decomposition of organic matter. These acids can react with the minerals in the rocks, leading to chemical weathering.\nUsually the product of acid reaction dissolved in water at one place, and they get transported to another place with water. There, these products can precipitate out of the solution and form new minerals. This process is called precipitation. For example, when calcium carbonate (CaCO3) dissolves in water, it can form calcium ions (Ca2+) and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-). When the concentration of these ions becomes high enough, they can precipitate out of the solution and form new minerals, such as calcite or aragonite.\n\nI find the following video very useful to understand the chemical weathering process and formation of Karst caves.\n\n\n\n\nBiological weathering is the process by which living organisms, such as plants, animals, and microorganisms, break down rocks and minerals. This process can occur through physical or chemical means and is an essential part of the rock cycle.\n\n\n\nBiological weathering leads to chemical weathering because biological processes, like those of plants and microorganisms, can produce acidic substances and chelating agents that chemically alter rock minerals.\n\n\n\nConsider you have a cube of size 10 cm. The volume of the cube denotes how big the particle of cube is. In this case it will be 1000 cm^3. A cube contains 6 faces, front, back, top, bottom, left, and right. Each face has an area of 10 cm x 10 cm = 100 cm^2. The total surface area of the cube is 6 x 100 cm^2 = 600 cm^2.\nNow let us divide this cube into two smaller parts. Then each piece will have 6 faces. So there are 12 faces in total. This will have more surface area than the original cube. This is because by cuttting the cude we have generated another face which was not there before (It was inside the cube and not exposed to the outside). This experiment tells us that as we cut the cube into smaller pieces, the mass of the cubes (collection of new smaller cubes) remain the same but the surface area increases. Therefore if we take one kg of sand (big particle) and grind it into smaller pieces (small particles), the mass will remain the same but the surface area will increase. We can use this concept to explain that one kg of clay will have more surface area than the one kg of sand. This is one of the reason why clay are more reactive than sand.\nClass question:\nLet us say that the size of the original cube is a, and the size of the smaller cube is b.\n\nBig cude calculation\n\nVolume = \\(a^3\\)\nSurface area = \\(6a^2\\)\n\nSmall cube calculation\n\nVolume = \\(b^3\\)\nSurface area = \\(6b^2\\)\nThere are 8 cubes of size b, therefore total surface area is \\(6b^2 x 8 = 48b^2\\)\n\nRelation between a and b is found by knowing that the volume of the big cube is equal to the volume of the small cubes. Therefore, \\(a^3 = 8b^3\\) or \\(a = 2b\\).\nRation of surface area of smaller cubes to the surface area of the big cube is \\(48b^2 / 6a^2 = 48b^2 / 6(2b)^2 = 48b^2 / 24b^2 = 2\\)."

These acids can react with the minerals in the rocks, leading to chemical weathering.\nUsually the product of acid reaction dissolved in water at one place, and they get transported to another place with water.

By well-drained soils, we mean that the soils have low water holding capacity and water can easily move through the soil profile. In addition such soils have poor nutrient holding capacity.\nWhen Jack Pine is grown in nitrate rich soils, there can be imbalance of nitrogent to other nutrient ration (such as phosphorus, potassium). This can lead to poor growth and development of Jack Pine as discussed in this paper.\nThe excessive nitrate (or N) in the soil will initially promote the growth but in the long term it will accelerate nutrient imbalance and reduce tree health. It may lead to the acidity of the soil (Du et al 2025). This will affect not only the tree health, such as nutrient status, primary production, growth, vitality and mortality, but also affecting plant diversity, microbial activity and nutrient availability as well as gaseous and leaching losses.\nJack pine’s nutrient uptake systems are adapted to low-nutrient environments, and excessive nitrogen can disrupt stoichiometric balances, particularly the nitrogen-to-phosphorus (N:P) and nitrogen-to-magnesium ratios.\nGreater availability of nitrogen may lead to allocation of resources to aboveground parts, possibly at the expense of root development. This could make trees more vulnerable to drought stress or windthrow, particularly in less sandy soils.\nJack pine plantations may not utilize all available nitrogen efficiently. This can lead to nitrate leaching into groundwater or eutrophication of nearby aquatic systems.\nPlease read the following paper for more information Zhou et al 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nNitrogen is an essential nutrient for all living organisms, integral to the formation of proteins, nucleic acids, and chlorophyll. Despite its abundance in the atmosphere as dinitrogen gas (N₂), most organisms cannot utilize it in this inert form. The nitrogen cycle encompasses a series of microbial-mediated processes that convert nitrogen into various chemical forms, facilitating its assimilation by living organisms. ￼ ￼\n\n\n\n\nNitrogen Fixation: This process converts atmospheric N₂ into ammonia (NH₃), a form accessible to plants. Biological nitrogen fixation is primarily carried out by specific prokaryotes, including free-living bacteria and symbiotic bacteria associated with plant roots. Abiotic processes, such as lightning and industrial activities, also contribute to nitrogen fixation. ￼\nNitrification: Ammonia is oxidized to nitrite (NO₂⁻) and subsequently to nitrate (NO₃⁻) by nitrifying bacteria. These forms are readily absorbed by plants but can also leach into water bodies, leading to environmental concerns. ￼\nAssimilation: Plants assimilate nitrate and ammonia to synthesize organic nitrogen compounds, which are then transferred through the food web. ￼\nAmmonification: Decomposition of organic nitrogen from dead organisms and waste products results in the release of ammonia back into the soil, making it available for other processes in the cycle.\nDenitrification: Under anaerobic conditions, denitrifying bacteria convert nitrate back into gaseous N₂, releasing it into the atmosphere and completing the cycle. ￼\n\n\n\n\nSince the mid-20th century, human activities have significantly disrupted the natural nitrogen cycle: ￼\n\nAgricultural Practices: The extensive use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers has increased the amount of bioavailable nitrogen in ecosystems, leading to nutrient imbalances and environmental issues such as eutrophication.\nFossil Fuel Combustion: Burning fossil fuels releases nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere, contributing to air pollution and acid rain.\nIndustrial Processes: The Haber-Bosch process has exponentially increased the amount of fixed nitrogen, surpassing natural fixation rates and altering global nitrogen dynamics. ￼\n\nThese anthropogenic influences have led to increased primary productivity in some ecosystems but have also caused detrimental effects, including biodiversity loss, water quality degradation, and the formation of hypoxic zones in aquatic environments.\n\n\n\nThe nitrogen cycle is a complex interplay of biological and chemical processes essential for sustaining life on Earth. Microorganisms play a pivotal role in facilitating the transformation of nitrogen into forms usable by plants and animals. However, human activities have significantly altered the natural balance of this cycle, leading to environmental challenges that necessitate sustainable management practices to mitigate adverse impacts. ￼\nPlease read the introduction of the following paper for a good overview of Nitrogen cycle in forest ecosystem.\n\nZhou et al 2020 Introduction section will given you enough information about importance of N in forest ecosystem.\nThe Nitrogen Cycle: Processes, Players, and Human Impact I recomment readng the Introduction section of this paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear-cutting, a forest disturbance resulting in the removal of all trees, significantly impacts soil nutrients. It can lead to increased soil nutrient losses, particularly nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), and changes in soil properties. These effects are due to reduced nutrient uptake by trees, changes in soil temperature and moisture, and alterations in soil structure.\n\nIncreased Soil Temperature and Water Percolation: Clear-cutting reduces evapotranspiration, leading to higher soil temperatures and increased water infiltration, which can accelerate nutrient leaching.\nChanges in Soil Structure: Clear-cutting can disrupt soil aggregate structure, making soils more prone to erosion and nutrient loss.\nIncreased Mineralization and Leaching: Following clear-cutting, nitrogen mineralization increases, and the resulting inorganic nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate) can be leached from the soil, potentially reaching groundwater and streams.\nLoss of Soil Organic Matter: Clear-cutting can accelerate the loss of soil organic matter (SOM), which is a crucial source of nutrients.\nEffects of clearcutting and girdling on soil respiration and fluxes of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen in a Japanese cedar plantation\nPlease read this article on clearing cutting of forest\nShort-term impacts of forest clear-cut on soil structure and consequences for organic matter composition and nutrient speciation: A case study\nEffects of whole-tree and stem-only clearcutting on forest floor and soil carbon and nutrients in a balsam fir\nClear-cut forest harvest impacts on soil quality indicators in the mixedwood forest of Saskatchewan, Canada\n\n\n\n\nForests are highly efficient in biogeochemical cycling, playing a crucial role in regulating the movement of elements like carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus between living organisms and the environment. This efficiency is due to a combination of factors, including high rates of photosynthesis, nutrient uptake from the soil, and nutrient recycling through processes like litterfall and decomposition.\nForest productivity can be assessed through the annual biomass gain per hectare. In tropical forests, rapid decomposition of organic debris ensures efficient nutrient recycling, preventing organic matter buildup and maintaining a balance between carbon input and output.\nIn contrast, temperate deciduous forests accumulate organic material, forming nutrient-rich humus, making them more effective at storing carbon and nitrogen compared to tropical forests. Boreal forests also serve as significant carbon and nitrogen sinks, but climate change is diminishing their extent, contributing to increased greenhouse gas emissions due to altered biogeochemical cycles.\nNitrogen enters forest soils through biological fixation—either via symbiotic relationships or atmospheric processes like lightning—and to a lesser extent through precipitation. In Estonia, nitrogen availability in forests is relatively low. Among native species, only alders engage in nitrogen fixation, enhancing soil fertility, though the process is energetically demanding; producing 100 kg of nitrogen can require around 2 tonnes of dry biomass from alder trees.\nPlease read the introduction and abstract of the following paper for more information on biogeochemical efficiency of forest ecosystems.\n\nForest production efficiency increases with growth temperature\n\n\n\n\nMineralization and immobilization are key processes in the nitrogen cycle, involving the transformation of nitrogen between organic and inorganic forms. Mineralization converts organic nitrogen to inorganic forms like ammonium, making it available to plants, while immobilization transforms inorganic nitrogen into organic forms within soil microbes, temporarily making it unavailable.\nThe following article provides a good overview of nitrogen cycle including mineralization and immobilization processes:\n\nPdf of Note on Nitrogen Cycle"

Abiotic processes, such as lightning and industrial activities, also contribute to nitrogen fixation. ￼\nNitrification: Ammonia is oxidized to nitrite (NO₂⁻) and subsequently to nitrate (NO₃⁻) by nitrifying bacteria. These forms are readily absorbed by plants but can also leach into water bodies, leading to environmental concerns. ￼\nAssimilation: Plants assimilate nitrate and ammonia to synthesize organic nitrogen compounds, which are then transferred through the food web. ￼\nAmmonification: Decomposition of organic nitrogen from dead organisms and waste products results in the release of ammonia back into the soil, making it available for other processes in the cycle.\nDenitrification: Under anaerobic conditions, denitrifying bacteria convert nitrate back into gaseous N₂, releasing it into the atmosphere and completing the cycle. ￼\n\n\n\n\nSince the mid-20th century, human activities have significantly disrupted the natural nitrogen cycle: ￼\n\nAgricultural Practices: The extensive use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers has increased the amount of bioavailable nitrogen in ecosystems, leading to nutrient imbalances and environmental issues such as eutrophication.\nFossil Fuel Combustion: Burning fossil fuels releases nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere, contributing to air pollution and acid rain.\nIndustrial Processes: The Haber-Bosch process has exponentially increased the amount of fixed nitrogen, surpassing natural fixation rates and altering global nitrogen dynamics. ￼\n\nThese anthropogenic influences have led to increased primary productivity in some ecosystems but have also caused detrimental effects, including biodiversity loss, water quality degradation, and the formation of hypoxic zones in aquatic environments.\n\n\n\nThe nitrogen cycle is a complex interplay of biological and chemical processes essential for sustaining life on Earth. Microorganisms play a pivotal role in facilitating the transformation of nitrogen into forms usable by plants and animals. However, human activities have significantly altered the natural balance of this cycle, leading to environmental challenges that necessitate sustainable management practices to mitigate adverse impacts. ￼\nPlease read the introduction of the following paper for a good overview of Nitrogen cycle in forest ecosystem.\n\nZhou et al 2020 Introduction section will given you enough information about importance of N in forest ecosystem.\nThe Nitrogen Cycle: Processes, Players, and Human Impact I recomment readng the Introduction section of this paper."

    "text": "Clear-cutting, a forest disturbance resulting in the removal of all trees, significantly impacts soil nutrients. It can lead to increased soil nutrient losses, particularly nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), and changes in soil properties. These effects are due to reduced nutrient uptake by trees, changes in soil temperature and moisture, and alterations in soil structure.\n\nIncreased Soil Temperature and Water Percolation: Clear-cutting reduces evapotranspiration, leading to higher soil temperatures and increased water infiltration, which can accelerate nutrient leaching.\nChanges in Soil Structure: Clear-cutting can disrupt soil aggregate structure, making soils more prone to erosion and nutrient loss.\nIncreased Mineralization and Leaching: Following clear-cutting, nitrogen mineralization increases, and the resulting inorganic nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate) can be leached from the soil, potentially reaching groundwater and streams.\nLoss of Soil Organic Matter: Clear-cutting can accelerate the loss of soil organic matter (SOM), which is a crucial source of nutrients.\nEffects of clearcutting and girdling on soil respiration and fluxes of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen in a Japanese cedar plantation\nPlease read this article on clearing cutting of forest\nShort-term impacts of forest clear-cut on soil structure and consequences for organic matter composition and nutrient speciation: A case study\nEffects of whole-tree and stem-only clearcutting on forest floor and soil carbon and nutrients in a balsam fir\nClear-cut forest harvest impacts on soil quality indicators in the mixedwood forest of Saskatchewan, Canada"

    "text": "Forests are highly efficient in biogeochemical cycling, playing a crucial role in regulating the movement of elements like carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus between living organisms and the environment. This efficiency is due to a combination of factors, including high rates of photosynthesis, nutrient uptake from the soil, and nutrient recycling through processes like litterfall and decomposition.\nForest productivity can be assessed through the annual biomass gain per hectare. In tropical forests, rapid decomposition of organic debris ensures efficient nutrient recycling, preventing organic matter buildup and maintaining a balance between carbon input and output.\nIn contrast, temperate deciduous forests accumulate organic material, forming nutrient-rich humus, making them more effective at storing carbon and nitrogen compared to tropical forests. Boreal forests also serve as significant carbon and nitrogen sinks, but climate change is diminishing their extent, contributing to increased greenhouse gas emissions due to altered biogeochemical cycles.\nNitrogen enters forest soils through biological fixation—either via symbiotic relationships or atmospheric processes like lightning—and to a lesser extent through precipitation. In Estonia, nitrogen availability in forests is relatively low. Among native species, only alders engage in nitrogen fixation, enhancing soil fertility, though the process is energetically demanding; producing 100 kg of nitrogen can require around 2 tonnes of dry biomass from alder trees.\nPlease read the introduction and abstract of the following paper for more information on biogeochemical efficiency of forest ecosystems.\n\nForest production efficiency increases with growth temperature"

Rayleigh scattering can scatter light in all directions, with a slight prevalence to the forward and backward directions relative to the incoming light.\nGas molecules such as oxygen and nitrogen along with very small dust particles are largely responsible for Rayleigh scattering.

They are often found in extreme environments such as hot springs, salt flats, and deep-sea hydrothermal vents.\n\nWe can also classify organisms into endothermic and ectothermic organisms based on their ability to regulate body temperature.\n\nEndothermic organisms: These organisms can regulate their body temperature internally, often through metabolic processes. They are commonly referred to as warm-blooded animals. Examples include mammals and birds.\nEctothermic organisms: These organisms rely on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. They are commonly referred to as cold-blooded animals. Examples include reptiles, amphibians, and fish.\n\n\n\n\nPlants regulate their temperature by dissipating part of thermal energy they absorb. In this way, they prevent them from injury and death due to excessive high temperature. Plants use heat transfer mechanisms to transfer heat to their environment. These mechanisms were discussed in Lecture 4. The heat transfer due to radiation will be discussed in Lecture 5.\nPlant can function properly under a broad range of temperature, generally between 0 and 50 degree C. Low temperature usually decreases the rate of photosynthesis. Nevertheless, significant photosynthesis can occur in conifers in cold climate.\nAs temperature increases, plant activities increases upto an optimum temperature. Temperature increase beyond optimum value can decreases the plant activities. Following processes are influenced strongly due to the temperature:\n\nThe activities of enzymes which catalyze the biochemical reactions in plant cells\nThe solubility of carbon dioxide and oxygen in plant cells\nTranpiration\nThe ability of root system to absorb water and nutrients\nMembrane permeability\n\nIn a plant different growth processes may require different optimum temperatures. Therefore, we cannot say that there is a single optimum temperature for which rate of plant growth or biomass product is highest. In this way, in a plant some growth happens at day time, some growth happen at night time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe difference between night time temperature and day time temperature is called thermoperiod.\n\n\nWe have discussed in the class that the rate of photosynthesis is highest at the optimum temperature. When temperature increases above the optimum temperature the rate of photosynthesis decreases. For example at about 30 degree C, many enzymes tend to become disrupted. If high temperature remains for a long period the enzymes become nonfunctional.\nWe also discussed in Lecture 4 that respiration increases greatly at very high temperature (50 degree C). Therefore, at very high temperature respiration will be higher than the photosynthesis. The respiration help the plant in releasing excess heat. But if the temperature increases further, it can result in death of plant cells. May studies have shown that the dangerous point occur at about 55 degree C.\nA plant can also rearrange its leaves so that it receives less sunlight. In this way, the plan can decreases the intake of thermal energy. For example when red maple seedlings are subjected to high light intensities, the leaf blades are deflected downward until they hand in a vertical position. In this position the light is tangential to the leaves and they minimizes the intake of thermal energy. When these seedlings are put in shade they return to the horizontal position.\n\n\n\nWhen temperature drops below 0 degree C, the water in the plant cells freezes. This can cause damage to the plant cells. The freezing of water in the plant cells can cause the formation of ice crystals, which can puncture and rupture the cell membranes. This can lead to cell death and tissue damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess of freezing in plants\n\n\n\nFirst the water between the two cells freezes. This type of freezing will create cryo-suction outside the cell zone, which will move water from the cell to outer freezing area. In this way, the amount of water in the cell decreases and it reaches to a point where there is only bounded water inside the cell (protoplasm). As temperature decreases furture, bound water is pulled away from the protoplasm. This process initiate protein denaturation and ultimately causing death of the cell.\n\n\nIn tropical plants, death may occur at above freezing temperatures from 0 to 10 degree C.\nRapid thawing in plants can also cause damage to the plant cells. When the temperature rises rapidly, the ice crystals in the plant cells can melt too quickly, causing the cell membranes to rupture. This can lead to cell death and tissue damage.\nMost trees in temperate and boreal zones starts to become inactive when the length of the day shortens and temperature drops. The plant lowers the water content of protoplasm by transferring water out of cells. Many species are able to survive below zero temperature without damage.\n\n\n\n\nThe boundary layer is a thin zone of calm air that surrounds each leaf.\nThe air is a poor conductor of heat. What it means is that the presence of SLOW moving air between two objects will reduce the rate of heat transfer between these two objects. Note that we are talking here about the SLOW or STATIC air (this is important). If the thickness of SLOW moving air is large, the heat transfer becomes more difficult. Therefore, a thin layer is more conducting then the thick layer.\nThe moving air can remove heat more quickly than the static air. This is because the moving air can carry away the heat from the surface of the leaf more efficiently than the static air. The moving air can also bring in cooler air to replace the warmer air that is near the surface of the leaf.\nTherefore, if the leaves are in direct contact with the moving air, they can easily exchange heat with it. However, if the boundary layer is present between the moving (FAST moving) air and leaves then it would be difficult to exchange heat with the air.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA thick boundary layer can reduce the transfer of heat, CO2 and water vapor from the leaf to the environment.\n\n\n\nThere are several factors that influence the boundary layer thickness including characteristics of the leaves themselves. Leaves that are larger in size, are not dissected, and have pubescence or hairs typically have thicker boundary layers.\nA dense canopy including very tight spacing of plants increases the boundary layer thickness. This is because the leaves are closer together and the air is not able to move freely between them. This can lead to a thicker boundary layer and reduced heat transfer.\nWind speed can also influence the boundary layer thickness. Higher wind speeds can reduce the boundary layer thickness by increasing the movement of air around the leaves. This can lead to more efficient heat transfer and increased cooling of the leaves.\nThis is one of the reasons why at least some air movement in a greenhouse is advised.\nSo when the boundary layer is thick, water loss from the leaf decreases and thus, water uptake through plant is diminished. This can cause nutrient deficiency.\n\nFollowing video explains the concept of boundary layer in detail."

For example when red maple seedlings are subjected to high light intensities, the leaf blades are deflected downward until they hand in a vertical position. In this position the light is tangential to the leaves and they minimizes the intake of thermal energy. When these seedlings are put in shade they return to the horizontal position."

    "text": "When temperature drops below 0 degree C, the water in the plant cells freezes. This can cause damage to the plant cells. The freezing of water in the plant cells can cause the formation of ice crystals, which can puncture and rupture the cell membranes. This can lead to cell death and tissue damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess of freezing in plants\n\n\n\nFirst the water between the two cells freezes. This type of freezing will create cryo-suction outside the cell zone, which will move water from the cell to outer freezing area. In this way, the amount of water in the cell decreases and it reaches to a point where there is only bounded water inside the cell (protoplasm). As temperature decreases furture, bound water is pulled away from the protoplasm. This process initiate protein denaturation and ultimately causing death of the cell.\n\n\nIn tropical plants, death may occur at above freezing temperatures from 0 to 10 degree C.\nRapid thawing in plants can also cause damage to the plant cells. When the temperature rises rapidly, the ice crystals in the plant cells can melt too quickly, causing the cell membranes to rupture. This can lead to cell death and tissue damage.\nMost trees in temperate and boreal zones starts to become inactive when the length of the day shortens and temperature drops. The plant lowers the water content of protoplasm by transferring water out of cells. Many species are able to survive below zero temperature without damage."

    "text": "The boundary layer is a thin zone of calm air that surrounds each leaf.\nThe air is a poor conductor of heat. What it means is that the presence of SLOW moving air between two objects will reduce the rate of heat transfer between these two objects. Note that we are talking here about the SLOW or STATIC air (this is important). If the thickness of SLOW moving air is large, the heat transfer becomes more difficult. Therefore, a thin layer is more conducting then the thick layer.\nThe moving air can remove heat more quickly than the static air. This is because the moving air can carry away the heat from the surface of the leaf more efficiently than the static air. The moving air can also bring in cooler air to replace the warmer air that is near the surface of the leaf.\nTherefore, if the leaves are in direct contact with the moving air, they can easily exchange heat with it. However, if the boundary layer is present between the moving (FAST moving) air and leaves then it would be difficult to exchange heat with the air.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA thick boundary layer can reduce the transfer of heat, CO2 and water vapor from the leaf to the environment.\n\n\n\nThere are several factors that influence the boundary layer thickness including characteristics of the leaves themselves. Leaves that are larger in size, are not dissected, and have pubescence or hairs typically have thicker boundary layers.\nA dense canopy including very tight spacing of plants increases the boundary layer thickness. This is because the leaves are closer together and the air is not able to move freely between them. This can lead to a thicker boundary layer and reduced heat transfer.\nWind speed can also influence the boundary layer thickness. Higher wind speeds can reduce the boundary layer thickness by increasing the movement of air around the leaves. This can lead to more efficient heat transfer and increased cooling of the leaves.\nThis is one of the reasons why at least some air movement in a greenhouse is advised.\nSo when the boundary layer is thick, water loss from the leaf decreases and thus, water uptake through plant is diminished. This can cause nutrient deficiency.\n\nFollowing video explains the concept of boundary layer in detail."

Successful germinants occur on recent flood deposits that have the requisite light, water and nutrients. Recent flood deposits dry out as the water table recedes, and first‐year growth and survival depend on whether seedling roots can descend into the soil quickly enough to tap receding water and nutrient supplies.\n\n\n\n\n\nsource: Adair and Binkley (2002)\nBig seeds contain large supplies of carbohydrates in it which might be beneficial for new germinants. So it might seem that all tree species should produce large seeds.\nNew germinants of pines benefit from seeds that are much larger than cottonwoods seeds (25 seeds per gram), and oak and walnut germinants have far larger seeds than pines (5–10 g for each seed).\nHowever, big seeds fall only in the vicinity near the mother tree, which is a difficult place for successful regeneration.\nLarge seeds may be eaten by birds and mammals, with chance of being destroyed (by digestion) or dispersed to favorable sites.\nTiny seeds allow for dispersion by wind with the potential that some seeds will land in favorable sites."

White pine needles and red oak leaves both have stomata that are sensitive to vapor pressure deficits, but the pine needles sustain more open stomata at all humidities (left). The amount of water lost from a leaf depends on stomatal conductance, the water status of the leaf (water potential, Figure 4.3), and the dryness of the air (right).

The term ecosystem is very general. However, from landscape ecosystem we want to emphasis that we are interested in studying the ecosystem which have finite volume such as forest. So such ecosystem are located on the specific parts of the earth. They have their own environment, and in this environment their can be so population of many types of species.\n\n\n\nI think to study the forest ecosystem, the first question that we should ask is where is that forest located on the earth?\nIs it is a tropical forest, or temperate forest, or boreal forest?\nThen we decide our are of interest by fixing the spatial scale of the forest ecosystem. This will fix the volume of the forest in the horizontal direction. Imagine a box which contains a part of very large forest.\nAfter fixing the volume of the forest, we see what types of living organisms are present in that volume.\nThen we see what is the geography in that volume, For example, what is the soil type, what is the water type, what is the air type, what is the temperature, what is the humidity, what is the light intensity, etc. We also check the topography.\nIn summary, in landscape ecosystem, and forest ecosystem, the landscape comes first, and then we study the components of that landscape. Whereas in general, many people are interested in studying an organism or species, or population. But if use such approach for a forest we have so many species and their ecosystem. Finding how these ecosystem (infinitely many) interacts with each other will be a challenging task if not impossible task.\n\n\n\n\nTo understand the different layers of a forest ecosystem, we need to follow the following steps.\n\nThe forest ecosystem occupy a finite volume (small or larger) on the earth’s surface.\nThe conditions, such as temperature, humidity, light, soil type, nutrients, rainfall (amount and frequency) will change across the earth surface. In this way, different types of plants (species) will grow at different location on the earth. Even if we focus on same species, their growth will be different at different location. This is because the conditions are different at different locations. This gives a horizontal structure to forest. All it means that the growth, species of plants and trees changes as the location changes.\nNow let us focus on the vertical structure of a forest. The vertical structure of the forest is divided in the terms of layers. For example, our body has differnt layers:\n\nLeg area: This is the area below the hip\nHip area: This is the area around the hip\nStomach area: This is the area around the stomach\nHead area: This is the area around the head\n\n\nSimilarly, in the forest at given location on the earth, we have different layers in the vertical direction. Now why in the vertical direction? Because at given location the trees are growing in the vertical direction (both up and down (roots)).\nNow, Let us focus on a SINGLE tree at a given location. What type of layers do we observe? 1. Root area (this is like leg area) below the ground 2. Trunk area (this is like hip and stomach area) above the ground 3. Crown area: Branch area (this is like head area) above the ground. 4. Canopy area: This is the area above the crown area. This is the area where the leaves are present.\nNow let us combine many trees at a given location. Let say we planted them together. Over the time they will grow at the different rate. Some trees will be taller and thicker. Some trees will be shorter. This the first generation of tree. They have same age, but their characteristics are different. After some years lets plant another generation of trees. Now in the forest we will have younger and older trees. Every individual tree has vertical structure.\nThe combination of these trees is what make the forest. So the forest also have several vertical layers. These layers were discussed in the lecture.\n\n\n\nOne student found it difficult to understand the tropical ecosystem.\n\nThe tropical ecosystem is a type of forest ecosystem.\nIt is a forest ecosystem that is located in the tropics.\nThe tropics are the regions of the earth that are located between the Tropic of Cancer (23 degree North) and the Tropic of Capricorn (23 degree South).\nThese regions are characterized by warm temperatures and high levels of rainfall. In general, as the latitude increases, the temperature decreases. Arctic and Antartica both have largest latitude in North and Sourth, respectively. They are also the cold region of the earth.\nFind the latitude of you location. For example, Kyoto’s latitude is 35.0116° N. So it is not in the tropics. The latitude of Mumbai, India is 19.0760° N. So it is in the tropics.\nYou can learn about the latitude of earth from this YouTube Video\nThe tropical ecosystem is home to a wide variety of plant and animal species, many of which are not found in other types of ecosystems.\nThe tropical ecosystem is also characterized by its high levels of biodiversity, which means that it has a large number of different species living in it.\nI also recommend students to see this YouTube Video to understand the tropical ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe population is a group of individuals of the same species that live in the same area at the same time.\nA population is defined as a group of individuals of the same species living and interbreeding within a given area.\nMembers of a population often rely on the same resources, are subject to similar environmental constraints, and depend on the availability of other members to persist over time.\nWe study a population by examining how individuals in that population interact with each other and how the population as a whole interacts with its environment.\nAs a tool for objectively studying populations, population ecologists rely on a series of statistical measures, known as demographic parameters, to describe that population.\nThe field of science interested in collecting and analyzing these numbers is termed population demographics, also known as demography.\n\nI strongly recommend students to watch the following YouTube Video to understand the concept of population.\n\nPopulation dynamics is an very intriguing subject.

    "text": "In general the term Spectra or Spectrum means the range of some values (for example, wavelength, frequency, energy).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSpectra aren’t just for light. Any kind of wave or energy — like sound, heat, or even chemicals — can have a spectrum.\n\nSound spectrum: low to high pitches.\nLight spectrum: red to violet colors, or even invisible light like infrared and ultraviolet.\nChemical spectra: patterns that help scientists identify what an object is made of, like a fingerprint for materials.\n\n\n\nFor example, you must have seen rainbow (see figure below). What you see is a range of colors from red to violet. The question is how do we define the rainbow. Well to tackle this question we use the term spectrum. So a rainbow is a collection (or spectra) of different colors. But what is a color? I mean is color a material property? How to I measure the value of color? Because, their can be several shades of red or blue. How do we associated a unique to each color?\nTo tackle the above issue we can use the concept of wave. Each wave have its wavelength, frequency, and speed (we will not go into the detail of each terms, lets focus only on the wavelength). So each color has a unique value of wavelength which is measured in meters. Now we can say that “a rainbow is a collection of different wavelength).\n\n\n\nRainbow\n\n\nNow lets expand the concept of spectrum to visible light. The visible light is a spectrum of electromagnetic waves of wavelengths ranging from 400 to 700 nm. What it means is that the visible light contains wavelengths from 400 nm to 700 nm.\n\n\n\nVisible light spectrum\n\n\nBut please note that we have not mentioned anything about the how much percentage of each wavelength is contain in the spectrum of visible light. However, this information is important as it characterizes the visible light. Because, if we have two sources of visible light; White LED and tungsten lamp. Then both of these source will emit visible light. But the percentage of each wavelength in the spectrum of these two sources will be different. We say that these two light sources have different VISIBLE spectrum.\n\n\n\nVisible spectrum of various light source\n\n\nNow let us focus on the spectrum of sunlight. It contains Visible light. But sunlight also contains other wavelengths such as ultraviolet(UV) and infrared (IR). The UV light has wavelength less than 400 nm and IR light has wavelength greater than 700 nm. The UV and Visible light are called shortwave radiation. The IR light is called longwave radiation. The IR light can be sensed as heat. We also have infrared cameras or night vision cameras which can detect the IR light.\nThe solar spectrum is given below.\n\n\n\nSpectrum of electromagnetic radiation, UV: 10 nm to 400 nm; Visible: 380 nm to 780 nm; Infrared: 780 nm to 1 mm\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above section we have discussed the concept of spectrum. We saw that the sunlight contains a range of wavelengths including UV, visible light and IR. Humans, animals, plants, and building also emit IR radiation, which is why we can see them in the dark using infrared cameras.\nThe question is why every object emits these radiations? This phenomenon is called the thermal radiation or black body radiation. According to this theory, every object which has a non-zero temperature (on absolute scale) emits radiation. In other words, thermal radiation is represented by the spectrum of electromagnetic waves of different wavelengths.\nHotter objects like sun emits shorwave radiation. Cooler objects like humans, animals, and plants emit longwave radiation. The amount of radiation emitted by an object is a function of its temperature. The higher the temperature, the more radiation is emitted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple definition of black body\n\n\n\nA black body is something that’s really good at absorbing and giving off heat — it’s like the perfect heater. It absorbs all light (or energy) that hits it — it doesn’t reflect or transmit any. It also gives off heat (in the form of light) more efficiently than anything else.\n\n\nA black body is a perfect absorber and emitter.\n\nPerfect Absorber: A black body absorbs all incoming electromagnetic radiation, regardless of frequency or angle of incidence.\nPerfect Emitter: It emits radiation at all wavelengths, with an intensity distribution that depends solely on its temperature.\n\n\n\n\nSpectra of black body radiation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey features of black body radiation\n\n\n\n\nTemperature Dependence: As the temperature of a black body increases, the peak of its emission curve shifts to shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies). This is described by Wien’s Displacement Law.\nIntensity Increase: The total emitted radiation increases rapidly with temperature, following the Stefan–Boltzmann Law, which states that the total energy emitted per unit surface area is proportional to the fourth power of the black body’s absolute temperature.\nContinuous Spectrum: Unlike discrete spectral lines emitted by gases, a black body emits a continuous spectrum of radiation.\n\n\n\nBlack body simulator\n\n\n\nBlack body radiation can occur in the absence of any medium. Due to thermal energy the electrons or atoms emits electromagnetic radiation. This is the source of black body radiation.\nBlack bodies are ideal emitters of radiation. They absorb all incident radiation and emit radiation at all wavelengths. The amount of radiation emitted by a black body is given by Planck’s law.\n\n\n\nA grey body is like a black body, but not perfect — it only emits a portion of the thermal radiation it could. In fact, most everyday objects are grey bodies. A grey body absorbs and emits less radiation than a black body at the same temperature.\nImagine two stoves that are equally hot. One is brand new and super efficient (the black body), and the other is older and less efficient (the grey body). The old one gives off less heat — even though it’s at the same temperature. The black body gives off 100% of what’s possible. The grey body gives off less than 100% — maybe 70%, 50%, or 90%, depending on the material.\nThe amount of radiation a grey body gives off is described by something called emissivity (\\(\\varepsilon\\)) — a number between 0 and 1. A perfect black body has an emissivity of 1, while a perfect reflector has an emissivity of 0. Most materials fall somewhere in between. Human skin has an emissivity of about 0.98 (almost a black body). Aluminum foil has a low emissivity (~0.05), which is why it’s used to reflect heat.\n\n\n\nNorth-facing slopes in the Northern Hemisphere receive less sunlight than south-facing slopes primarily due to the angle of the Sun’s path in the sky, which is a consequence of the Earth’s axial tilt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTilt of the earth\n\n\n\nThe Earth is tilted at an angle of approximately 23.5° relative to its orbital plane around the Sun. As a result:\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the Sun is always positioned to the south of the zenith (the point directly overhead) for most of the year.\nThis means sunlight approaches the Earth’s surface from a southerly direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nA south-facing slope in the Northern Hemisphere is oriented toward the Sun, thereby receiving more direct solar radiation.\nA north-facing slope, in contrast, faces away from the Sun and thus receives less direct sunlight, especially during the cooler half of the year.\n\n\n\nI think the following video is very helpful in understanding the concept of north and south facing slopes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne liter of water weighs 1 kg.\nOne liter of water evaporated requires \\(2,260 kJ\\) of energy.\nLet us say \\(20 M/m^{2}\\) of energy is available for evaporation. Note that, this is not the total energy available for evaporation. This is the energy available for evaporation per square meter of surface.\nLet us consider the area of \\(1 m^{2}\\). So this area will receive \\(20 MJ\\) of energy.\n\\(20 MJ\\) of energy will evaporate about 8.85 kg of water, which is about 8.85 liters.\n1 liter is equal to \\(0.001 m^3\\), therefore, 8.85 liters is equal to \\(0.00885 m^3\\).\nVolume (V) of a cube is area (A) * height (H).\n\n\\[\nV = A * H\n\\]\nTherefore, the height of a cube with \\(1 m^2\\) area and \\(0.00885 m^3\\) volume is equal to \\(0.00885 m\\). This is equal to \\(8.85 cm\\).\n\nTherefore \\(20 MJ\\) of energy can evaporate \\(8.85 cm\\) of water from a \\(1 m^2\\) area.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrees receives shortwave radiation from the sunlight. Trees are not perfect black bodies so they will reflect some part of short radiation.\nTrees also have non-zero temperature. Therefore, they will emit thermal radiation. The question is what type of thermal radiation they emit? The temperature of tree is not so high. Therefore, like humans and animals, tree will emit longwave radiation.\n\nThe source of longwave radiation is the thermal energy of tree. The source of shortwave radiation from trees is the reflection of sunlight."

    "text": "Why do trees break or uproot?\n\nWhen wind pushes against tree tops, the tree stays upright because of its strong trunk and roots that hold firmly in the ground. The tree transfers the wind’s force down into the soil.\nTrees sway in the wind, deflecting some of the horizontal force of the wind.\nPalm trees have a special ability to bend. During strong hurricanes, the top part of the tree can bend almost sideways, and the leaves flatten against each other. This helps reduce the pressure on the tree trunk and prevents it from breaking.\nThis article explains How do palm trees withstand hurricanes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen trees have deep roots or roots firmly anchored in rocks, strong winds can snap their trunks, leaving a rooted stump in the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a tree’s trunk is stronger than its roots’ grip in the soil, the entire tree gets pulled up from the ground."

A decade after the fire (left photos), some portions of the burned area had pines with understories of grasses and forbs, and other areas had N‐fixing snowbrush shrubs that germinated after lying dormant in the soil for almost a century. Twenty‐five years after the fire, the trees have begun to redevelop a seed bank in serotinous cones (right photos), and snowbrush had replenished its soil seed bank.

A) Karri (a eucalyptus species) after a fire in western Australia, (B) an English oak in southern Portugal 1.5 years after fire (C) Canary pine (D) Close up of epicormic sprouting 3 months after fire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany species resprout from surviving root systems or base of stems. (A) Aspen sprouts (B) Redwood trees can sprout from the base after fire"

    "text": "Negative impacts of forest fire\n\n\nSoil erosion\n\nWhen rain falls on a forest, trees and the soft forest floor (O horizon) absorb the energy of raindrops.\nThe unburned forest floor normally works like a sponge, soaking up large amounts of water and slowly releasing it into the soil below.\nAfter a fire burns away these protective layers, raindrops hit the ground with full force, striking ash and soil particles directly.\nWithout this spongy layer, rainwater can come down faster than the soil can absorb it, causing water to flow across the surface and wash away soil."

This can lead to erosion on steep slopes.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoil can have patches that repel water"
