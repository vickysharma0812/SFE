    "text": "The following points were discussed in the lecture.\n\nAn ecosystem is a community of living organisms (plants, animals, and microorganisms) interacting with their physical environment (soil, water, and air).\nForest is a type of landscape ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do we have two terms landscape-ecosystem and ecosystem?\n\n\n\nIn my opinion, both ecosystem and landscape ecosystem are essentially the same. The term ecosystem is very general. However, from landscape ecosystem we want to emphasis that we are interested in studying the ecosystem which have finite volume such as forest. So such ecosystem are located on the specific parts of the earth. They have their own environment, and in this environment their can be so population of many types of species.\n\n\n\nI think to study the forest ecosystem, the first question that we should ask is where is that forest located on the earth?\nIs it is a tropical forest, or temperate forest, or boreal forest?\nThen we decide our are of interest by fixing the spatial scale of the forest ecosystem. This will fix the volume of the forest in the horizontal direction. Imagine a box which contains a part of very large forest.\nAfter fixing the volume of the forest, we see what types of living organisms are present in that volume.\nThen we see what is the geography in that volume, For example, what is the soil type, what is the water type, what is the air type, what is the temperature, what is the humidity, what is the light intensity, etc. We also check the topography.\nIn summary, in landscape ecosystem, and forest ecosystem, the landscape comes first, and then we study the components of that landscape. Whereas in general, many people are interested in studying an organism or species, or population. But if use such approach for a forest we have so many species and their ecosystem. Finding how these ecosystem (infinitely many) interacts with each other will be a challenging task if not impossible task.\n\n\n\n\nTo understand the different layers of a forest ecosystem, we need to follow the following steps.\n\nThe forest ecosystem occupy a finite volume (small or larger) on the earth’s surface.\nThe conditions, such as temperature, humidity, light, soil type, nutrients, rainfall (amount and frequency) will change across the earth surface. In this way, different types of plants (species) will grow at different location on the earth. Even if we focus on same species, their growth will be different at different location. This is because the conditions are different at different locations. This gives a horizontal structure to forest. All it means that the growth, species of plants and trees changes as the location changes.\nNow let us focus on the vertical structure of a forest. The vertical structure of the forest is divided in the terms of layers. For example, our body has differnt layers:\n\nLeg area: This is the area below the hip\nHip area: This is the area around the hip\nStomach area: This is the area around the stomach\nHead area: This is the area around the head\n\n\nSimilarly, in the forest at given location on the earth, we have different layers in the vertical direction. Now why in the vertical direction? Because at given location the trees are growing in the vertical direction (both up and down (roots)).\nNow, Let us focus on a SINGLE tree at a given location. What type of layers do we observe? 1. Root area (this is like leg area) below the ground 2. Trunk area (this is like hip and stomach area) above the ground 3. Crown area: Branch area (this is like head area) above the ground. 4. Canopy area: This is the area above the crown area. This is the area where the leaves are present.\nNow let us combine many trees at a given location. Let say we planted them together. Over the time they will grow at the different rate. Some trees will be taller and thicker. Some trees will be shorter. This the first generation of tree. They have same age, but their characteristics are different. After some years lets plant another generation of trees. Now in the forest we will have younger and older trees. Every individual tree has vertical structure.\nThe combination of these trees is what make the forest. So the forest also have several vertical layers. These layers were discussed in the lecture.\n\n\n\nOne student found it difficult to understand the tropical ecosystem.\n\nThe tropical ecosystem is a type of forest ecosystem.\nIt is a forest ecosystem that is located in the tropics.\nThe tropics are the regions of the earth that are located between the Tropic of Cancer (23 degree North) and the Tropic of Capricorn (23 degree South).\nThese regions are characterized by warm temperatures and high levels of rainfall. In general, as the latitude increases, the temperature decreases. Arctic and Antartica both have largest latitude in North and Sourth, respectively. They are also the cold region of the earth.\nFind the latitude of you location. For example, Kyoto’s latitude is 35.0116° N. So it is not in the tropics. The latitude of Mumbai, India is 19.0760° N. So it is in the tropics.\nYou can learn about the latitude of earth from this YouTube Video\nThe tropical ecosystem is home to a wide variety of plant and animal species, many of which are not found in other types of ecosystems.\nThe tropical ecosystem is also characterized by its high levels of biodiversity, which means that it has a large number of different species living in it.\nI also recommend students to see this YouTube Video to understand the tropical ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe population is a group of individuals of the same species that live in the same area at the same time.\nA population is defined as a group of individuals of the same species living and interbreeding within a given area.\nMembers of a population often rely on the same resources, are subject to similar environmental constraints, and depend on the availability of other members to persist over time.\nWe study a population by examining how individuals in that population interact with each other and how the population as a whole interacts with its environment.\nAs a tool for objectively studying populations, population ecologists rely on a series of statistical measures, known as demographic parameters, to describe that population.\nThe field of science interested in collecting and analyzing these numbers is termed population demographics, also known as demography.\n\nI strongly recommend students to watch the following YouTube Video to understand the concept of population.\n\nPopulation dynamics is an very intriguing subject. I can recommend the following article to understand the concept of population in an ecosystem.\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/introduction-to-population-demographics-83032908/"

Successful germinants occur on recent flood deposits that have the requisite light, water and nutrients. Recent flood deposits dry out as the water table recedes, and first‐year growth and survival depend on whether seedling roots can descend into the soil quickly enough to tap receding water and nutrient supplies.\n\n\n\n\n\nsource: Adair and Binkley (2002)\nBig seeds contain large supplies of carbohydrates in it which might be beneficial for new germinants. So it might seem that all tree species should produce large seeds.\nNew germinants of pines benefit from seeds that are much larger than cottonwoods seeds (25 seeds per gram), and oak and walnut germinants have far larger seeds than pines (5–10 g for each seed).\nHowever, big seeds fall only in the vicinity near the mother tree, which is a difficult place for successful regeneration.\nLarge seeds may be eaten by birds and mammals, with chance of being destroyed (by digestion) or dispersed to favorable sites.\nTiny seeds allow for dispersion by wind with the potential that some seeds will land in favorable sites."

Soil is nutrient-poor and acidic due to rapid decomposition and leaching."
