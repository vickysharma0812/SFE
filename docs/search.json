In this way, there are nearly infinite numbers of ecosystems. And it is difficult to study such systems.\nOn the other hand, Rowe(1961), Troll (1968), view ecosystem centered on geographic or landscape unit. Organisms are important components oof landscape ecosystem. In this waay, when we study landscape ecosystem, it is implied that organisms, species, and communities are part of such system."
