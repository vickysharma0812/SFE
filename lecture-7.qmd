## Water/Hydrological Cycle

## Transpiration

- Transpiration: Process of water movement through a plant out into the atmosphere from aerial parts, such as leaves, stems and flowers.
- As water loss happens even in the absence of rainfall, transpiration is also called dry leaf evaporation.
- Controlled by opening and closing of stomata in response to wet or drought like conditions.
- Conifers are very good at closing their stomata and thus are very efficient in conserving water.

## Evaporation

- Evaporation refers to the loss of water intercepted on the leaf surface to vapour stat. Hence, it is also called wet leaf evaporation.
- Water may be intercepted from rainfall or fog.
- Forests and grasslands have similar transpiration rates, but evaporation loss is much more in forests.
- Evaporation loss depend upon several factors including canopy structure and climatic conditions of the forest site.

## Effect of Canopy structure on Evaporation
