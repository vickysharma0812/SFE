## Learning objectives

- Effect of physical environment on the forest development
- Temperature, water regime, and solar radiation

## Heat loss in leaves {.smaller}

The leaf can also lose its thermal energy by following mechanisms.

- When the leaves are exposed to cooler air.
- The leaf can lose thermal energy by evaporating water (controlled through stomata). This is because evaporation of water is an endothermic process. The leaves use their thermal energy to heat water and convert them liquid into vapour.
- The leaves can also lose energy by emitting radiant energy.

## Heat loss in leaves due to cooler air {.smaller}

- When cool air pass over the leaves, the thermal energy is transferred to the air trough conduction and convection mechanisms.
- The rate of energy transfer (by conduction) into the air depends on the gradient of temperature between the leaf and the air.
- The rate of heat transfer also depends upon the surface area of the leaves which are in contact with the air.

- @leuzinger2007 showed that forest canopies play a major role in biosphere-atmosphere interactions.

- Large surfaces, such as beech leaves, have stable layers of air moleculs comprising a thick boundary layer. This thick boundary layer slow down the energy transfer from leaves to air at large.

- Small surfaces have thinner boundary layers. They allow fater transfer of thermal energy between leaves and air.

- The thickness of boundary layer decreases with increase in wind speed.

## Heat loss in leaves due to evaporation {.smaller}

- The evaporation of water requiresa huge amount of energy; to evaporate 1 liter of water we need to supply 2.4 MJ of energy.
- The faster the rate of evaporation faster will be the rate of energy loss (i.e., cooling)
- The rate of evaporation, however, depends upon several factors such as:
    - amount of water available in the tree
    - dryness of air (temperatue and humidity of air)
    - wind pressure, speed, and thickness of boundary layer


## Heat loss due to radiation {.smaller}

- Earlier, it was mentioned that the leaves can loose energy by emitting radiation.

::: {.callout-note title="Thermal radiation"}
- Thermal radiation is the emission of electromagnetic waves from all matter that has non zero absolute temperature.
- The energy is emitted in the form of photons and does not require a medium for propagation.
- Thermal radiation is also called as black body radiation.

## Black body radiation (thermal radiation) {.smaller}

::: {.callout-note}
Thermal radiation is also called as black body radiation.
:::

- A 'black-body' is a theoretical object in thermal equilibrium that absorbs all light that is incident upon it.
- Black-bodies have a single, well-defined temperature.
- The surface of the sun is a good approximation of these requirements.
- Black-body objects emit electromagnetic radiation. The spectrum of this radiation depends solely on the temperature of the object, as described by [Planck's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law).

## Heat loss due to radiation {.smaller}

- The instensity of thermal radiation emitted by an object is given by Stefan-Boltzmann law:

$$
j = \varepsilon \sigma T^{4}
$$

where,

- $j$ is the intensity of the thermal radiation (energy per unit area per unit time)
- $\varepsilon$ is the emissivity, which is a material property
- $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant ($5.67 \times 10^{-8} W m^{-2} K^{-4}$)
- T is absolute temperatue in Kelvin.

## Heat loss due to radiation {.smaller}

- So Stefan-Boltzmann law states that a body which has non zero absolute temperature emits thermal radiation. Hotter bodies emit more energy than the cooler ones.
- Thermal radiation emitted by a body at any temperature consists of a wide range of frequencies.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
The dominant frequency (or color) range of the emitted radiation shifts to higher frequencies as the temperature of the emitter increases. 
:::

- The energy is emitted in the form of photons, which has following expression for its energy.

$$
E = h \nu = h \frac{c}{\lambda}
$$

- $h$ is the Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\lambda$ and $\nu$ are the wavelength and frequency of the wave.


## Heat loss due to radiation {.smaller}

- The sun is very hot (surface temperature about 5770 K),  so the thermal radiation emitted by the sun contains very high frequencies or very short wavelengths ("shortwave radiation")

- However, if the wavelengths are larger than the visible spectrum then we cannot see those bodies, and we need Infrared imaging (Thermography).

## Heat loss due to radiation {.smaller}

::: {.callout-tip}
- An object at room temperature (20 degree celcius) shines out 420 W/m2 energy .
- If we increase the temperature to 37 degree celcius then it will emit 520 W/m2 energy.
:::

- The loss of energy due to radiation cools the objects, which in turn, lowers the rate of further radiation. The energy loss may be counteracted by any energy being added to the surface from the environment, and temperature stabilize when the energy gains from the environment matches the energy losses.

## Solar Spectrum

- The solar spectrum is the range of electromagnetic radiation emitted by the sun, extending from the ultraviolet to the infrared region. 
- It is composed of photons with various wavelengths, which define the spectrum’s shape and intensity. 
- It can be defined in terms of solar radiation or solar irradiance. 
- Solar radiation is the direct emission of energy from the sun while solar irradiance is the amount of energy that reaches the Earth’s surface.
- The solar spectrum can be divided into three main regions: the ultraviolet (UV), visible, and infrared (IR).
- The UV includes light with a wavelength shorter than 400 nanometers (nm). UV photons have energies ranging from approximately 3 to 5 electron Volts (eV). The visible region extends from 400 to 700 nm. This region contains photons with energies of 1.8 to 3 eV. Finally, the IR region comprises of light of wavelengths longer than 1000 nm, and its photons have energies between approximately 0.35 eV and 1.8 eV.
- The intensity of the solar spectrum received on Earth is strongly dependent on the Earth-Sun distance, the angle at which the sun’s rays reach the Earth’s atmosphere, the weather, and the amount of air pollution.
- Solar cells, which use photovoltaic technology to convert solar radiation into electricity, are highly sensitive to the shape of the solar spectrum and the intensity of the radiation.
- Therefore, researchers and engineers working on solar cells must be knowledgeable about the solar spectrum in order to achieve optimal performance and efficiency. Therefore, the solar spectrum is an important phenomenon to consider when designing and working with solar cells.

## Solar radiation

- The average distance between the Earth and the Sun is approximately 150 million kilometres. 
- This means that rays of sunlight are approximately parallel when they arrive at Earth.
- However, the amount of solar radiation which reaches Earth varies based on the time of year. 
- This is due to variations in the Earth-Sun distance, which varies between approximately 147 million km at perihelion in January to 152 million km at aphelion in July.

## Tilt of the earth

- The Earth is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees relative to the plane of its orbit around the Sun.
- The angle at which the light intercepts the atmosphere is the governing factor in the irradiance at the top of the atmosphere. This angle is called the solar zenith angle, $\theta_{s}$ and is the angle between the sun's rays and local vertical.
- Due to the spherical shape of the Earth, the greater $\theta_{s}$, the larger the area that the sun's rays are spread over.

## Solar Irradiance

- The atmosphere is a particularly important factor in determining local terrestrial solar irradiance as it causes significant changes between the radiation at the top of the atmosphere and what reaches the ground.
- Certain wavelengths are preferentially absorbed or scattered by atoms/molecules in the air. 
- Absorption is the process whereby a photon of light transfers all its energy to an atom/molecule. It does this by promoting an electron to a higher energy level, such that the photon no longer exists. Consequently, its energy is effectively converted to heating the absorber (sometimes a photon can be remitted in a process called fluorescence, but this is rare in the atmosphere).
- At ultraviolet wavelengths below 400 nm, O3 (ozone) is the primary absorber of radiation. Molecules in the atmosphere scatter incoming solar radiation into random directions. This is known as Rayleigh scattering and is responsible for the reduction in irradiance throughout the visible part of the spectrum.
- Molecular oxygen (O2) is responsible for some absorption of light in the red and near infrared region (600 nm – 800 nm), as is water vapour (H2O), which also has strong absorption bands for light in the mid-infrared region up to 3000 nm. 
- Carbon dioxide (CO2) begins to contribute to absorption of light above approximately 2500 nm.
- Atmospheric constituents can also scatter sunlight. Here, the photons are deflected from their original trajectory by molecules/particles rather than being absorbed. The two types of scattering that are most prevalent in the atmosphere are Mie scattering and Rayleigh scattering. Both are types of elastic scattering, so the wavelength (λ) of light is unchanged by the scattering process.
- Rayleigh scattering occurs when the diameter (d) of the scatterer is much smaller than the wavelength of the light it is scattering. The intensity of Rayleigh scattering is proportional to λ-4, so it is far more efficient for short wavelengths (blue light) than long wavelengths (red/IR light). Rayleigh scattering can scatter light in all directions, with a slight prevalence to the forward and backward directions relative to the incoming light.
- Gas molecules such as oxygen and nitrogen along with very small dust particles are largely responsible for Rayleigh scattering. This occurs mostly in the upper atmosphere. The preferential scattering of blue light by Rayleigh scattering is why the sky appears blue during the day and red at sunrise/sunset. Rayleigh scattering is also largely responsible for diffuse horizontal irradiance.
- Mie scattering occurs when the diameter of the scatterer is equal to or larger than the wavelength of light. It preferentially scatters light in the forward direction, with larger particles scattering more heavily in favour of the forward direction. The intensity of Mie scattering is not heavily wavelength dependent. It occurs mostly in the lower atmosphere from water vapour and large dust particles/pollutants. Mie scattering is why clouds and fog appear white.
